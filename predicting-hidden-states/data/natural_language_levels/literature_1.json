  "assistant": "\"HERE, I want this luggage taken—Hallo, Pollard! You're the man for me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Nigel Browning!\" ejaculated the porter addressed, a huge individual six feet three in height, and massive in frame, with a large face, resplendently good-humoured. He had been heaving great trunks and packing-cases out of the van, tossing one upon another, as a girl might heap together a pile of band-boxes. Now the train passed on groaning dismally after the fashion of these modern behemoths; and the platform crowd began to disperse.\n\nIt was past nine o'clock on a chilly autumn evening: not the kind of evening which might tempt anybody to linger under the flaring gas-lights, dimmed by fogginess.\n\nPollard, in full career across the platform, brought up his truck with a jerk on hearing his own name, then plucked at his cap with an air of delight.\n\n\"Mr. Nigel Browning!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"To be sure. Whom else would you take me for? Shake hands, Pollard. I've been round the world since I saw you last.\"\n\nThe man's hard palm closed with a grip round the fingers held out to him.\n\n\"And you ain't changed, Mr. Nigel. No need for to ask that, though. If you was, you wouldn't be a-shaking hands with me here, like to old days. And the niggers ain't got hold of you, nor none of they cannibals neither.\"\n\n\"Why, no—I've not been enjoying very largely the society of cannibals.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you've come back anyway a deal stouter and stronger than you was—not as you're stout yet, so to speak, but you was thin and no mistake when you went away. And I do see a difference. I don't know as you ain't taller too.\"\n\n\"Taller after twenty! That would be against all rule. However, I certainly did depart a scarecrow, so perhaps it's admissible to turn up a Hercules. All well at home, Pollard?—Wife and chicks, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, thank you. Naught but the old woman's rheumatiz for to grumble at—and she do say it takes a deal o' patience to carry that about with a body.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it, poor thing. And all right at the Grange?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir—so as I've heard. Save and except Mr. Browning's the same as usual, sir. Which in course you knows.\"\n\n\"Ah—yes,\" the two syllables being divided by a thoughtful break. Manner and voice had till this moment been marked by a frank joyousness, boy-like yet manly, but now there came a touch of gravity into Nigel's face. He stood for three seconds gazing across the rails into a misty distance, lost in cogitation; then roused himself.\n\n\"You will have the trunks up soon. I must be off.\"\n\n\"All right, sir.\"\n\nLeaving his ticket with the collector, Nigel passed into the street. He went onwards in a swift steadfast manner; vigour and decision being apparent in every motion of the alert well-proportioned figure.\n\nIt did not surprise Nigel that nobody was at the station to meet him after his year of absence, wherein he had travelled literally \"round the world.\" He had not expected to arrive till next morning, but finding an earlier train than he had hoped for \"within catch,\" the temptation to surprise his home-folks had proved irresistible.\n\nNewton Bury had been his home through life, and every wall and window in this busy High Street was familiar to him. Shops were shut, and people from within were airing themselves on the pavements after a hard day's work. Nigel saw many a well-known face as he went by, but he had no wish to be delayed, and it was easy to avoid recognition in the broken light of gas-lamps placed by no means too near together.\n\nLeaving High Street and Broad Street, he hesitated one moment at the foot of some stone steps leading upward. This was the short-cut between station and home; for Newton Bury was a town built partly upon hills; and the Grange stood high. But a certain attraction drew him along the main thoroughfare.\n\n\"After all, it's not ten minutes' difference; and I should like one glimpse,\" he said to himself.\n\n\"Hallo! What next? Have a care, young fellow.\"\n\nNigel certainly was going at express speed, when on turning a sharp corner, he barely escaped collision with a short and round-shouldered individual of advanced age, wearing a fur-bordered greatcoat almost down to the heels, and a Glengarry cap, from beneath which flowed thick locks of snow-white hair. Two black eyes, bright as beads, flashed a glance of indignant remonstrance, and the high-pitched voice, petulant in tone, was unmistakable.\n\n\"Mr. Carden-Cox. I beg your pardon. How do you do?\" Nigel put out his hand in greeting.\n\nThe other stared haughtily. \"Eh! who are you?\"\n\n\"Don't you know me?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I have not that pleasure,\" with an aggrieved sound.\n\n\"I'm Nigel—just come home.\"\n\n\"Young Browning. Humph.\"\n\nIt was dull and damp, the fogginess having deepened, and this no doubt was partly the reason why Nigel had so nearly run the old gentleman down, added to that old gentleman's perverse habit of walking on the wrong side of the pavement. But Mr. Carden-Cox had plainly no intention of allowing his movements to be influenced by weather. He pulled off one of his gloves, fished laboriously for a double eye-glass, adjusted the same carefully on the bridge of his nose, and retreated to the neighbourhood of the nearest lamp, beckoning Nigel to follow.\n\n\"Here, let me see. Nigel Browning! I declare I shouldn't have known the lad.\"\n\n\"Am I so altered?\"\n\n\"Altered! There's not an inch of you the same.\"\n\nThis was absurd, and Nigel smiled.\n\n\"What are you after here—eh?\"\n\n\"Going home. Just arrived. They don't expect me till to-morrow, so it's to be a surprise.\"\n\n\"Why on earth didn't you take the steps? Missed them in the dark? That's not like you. Some folks do go mooning about with their eyes in the stars; but I thought you were practical.\"\n\n\"I didn't miss the steps. I came this way by choice.\"\n\n\"Hey? What for?\"\n\n\"A fancy of mine. I must be off, or my luggage will arrive first.\"\n\n\"Not if you keep up the pace you were going just now.\" Mr. Carden-Cox paused to survey Nigel all over, from head to foot, as if gauging his value. \"Yes—you've filled out—expanded—developed—twice the man you were! But there's something about you which I don't quite understand. Good-bye. We shall meet again soon.\"\n\nNigel did not fail to keep up his former pace, even to accelerate it. If he wished to arrive before his luggage, he really had no time to lose, for Pollard would not be guilty of delay. And instead of following the bend to the right which Pollard would follow, Nigel soon shot away to the left, through a dark lane, with high walls on both sides, and a fringe of tall trees from enclosed gardens peeping over the wall-tops.\n\nThis lane led direct into a large square, chiefly composed of old-fashioned red-brick houses, each varying in shape and size from its neighbours. At the entrance to the square, where three short posts barred the way to vehicles, Nigel paused to look.\n\nThat was what he had come for: to indulge himself in a look.\n\nThe square was rightly named \"Church Square,\" for its centre was occupied by a venerable edifice, parts of which, including the square solid tower, were at least seven hundred years old. Generation after generation of English churchmen, through century after century, had met for worship within those aged walls. They had outlived countless historical tides and storms, and still stood there, rock-like and calm, always the same, in themselves a silent yet speaking history of ages past. Where Nigel stood, he could distinguish two flying buttresses, and two nearer side-windows, pointed yet somewhat broad. What he could not see he could imagine; for every inch of the structure was familiar and dear to him.\n\nAt one corner of the square, that to Nigel's left, a red-brick house stood alone, not placed in line like the rest, but occupying a small garden, wherein flourished an abundance of shrubs, but few flowers; for the Rev. Launcelot Elvey, Vicar of Newton Bury, with a cure of six thousand souls, and a stipend of two hundred and eighty pounds a year, had little money to spare for luxuries. What he could spare from absolute home necessaries went to the Parish.\n\nNigel had not meant to advance one step farther than this entrance to the square, where the three posts stood side by side. He cast one glance towards the central building; then his eyes went to the Vicarage.\n\nIt was very near; within a stone's throw. He could distinctly see the two small windows of the little drawing-room, a queer-shaped room, as he knew, all corners and crevices with furniture old enough to be picturesque, and old enough also to be shabby. Lights were lighted within, and blinds were drawn. As Nigel gazed, the shadow of a girlish figure was thrown with clear outline upon one of the blinds. Ethel—of course!\n\nHe had not intended to go a step nearer, but the pull was strong. That soft shade upon the blind had set all his pulses throbbing. The year's absence had made no difference at all—unless the difference that Ethel was dearer to him than ever—and the longing for one glimpse of her face became overwhelming. His luggage might arrive first; his home-folks might be perplexed, worried, perhaps hurt that he could put them second to anybody,—yes, he knew all this, but for three seconds nothing seemed of the smallest importance, except the glimpse for which he craved.\n\nNigel left the posts and went quickly towards the Vicarage; a few steps bringing him within the garden gate. At the same moment somebody drew up one of the blinds, and opened wide the window.\n\nEthel herself! He could see in strong relief against the light within, her slim prettily-rounded figure, could hear the soft happy tones which had always seemed to him to have a ripple of music running through them.\n\n\"Mother, we'll let in a breath of air just for a minute. It is so mild to-night. Lance, is that somebody in the garden?\"\n\nNigel almost uttered the word—\"Ethel!\" Almost, but not quite. It was leaving his lips, when he caught it back. Once within that room, how could he tear himself away?\n\nThere were reasons why it might be better not. With an effort Nigel turned and walked out of the gate. And as he went, he found himself face to face with somebody coming in—a large loosely-built man in a greatcoat, walking with the tired stoop in head and shoulders often born of a hard day's work. The light of the nearest lamp fell upon a rugged face, full of the beauty of goodness.\n\n\"Anything wanted?\" asked the Vicar.\n\nMr. Elvey never by any chance passed a human being who might \"want\" something of him.\n\n\"No—thanks,\" Nigel answered dutifully, hoping but not wishing to pass on.\n\n\"I know that voice!\" said the Vicar."
