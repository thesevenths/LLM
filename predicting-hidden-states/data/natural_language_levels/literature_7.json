  "assistant": "CHAPTER I: GANGDOM CHALLENGES\n\nPatrolman Tom Jennings, who claimed he had a flair for poetry, described him thus:\nA talking fool with a voice like a dove\nAnd a face that only a mother could love,\nSmall and ready to fight at a nod\nWas Officer Cates of the wave-length squad.\n\nWhich, after all, wasn’t so far out of the way. For certainly young Dave Cates, official announcer for the police division of radio station KYK, was far from being an Adonis. He had a measure of pugnacity, and he had a splendid voice.\n\nCates was talking now before the microphone in the police room over the studio of KYK. Smoothly his voice went out to the world:\n\n“The rush order on the new uniforms for the men of the Dolliver Street detail has been filled and the uniforms have been sent out. Orders are that they be put on as soon as received.”\n\nNot particularly interesting to thousands of the idly curious who chanced to be tuned in, but decidedly interesting to listening police details all over the great city. To them the code dispatch meant this:\n\n    “Big Ed” Margolo is free, having been acquitted of the murder charge against him. Dolliver Street detail must guard against resumption of gang war between Margolo and “Red” McGuirk. \n\nAs the announcer was about to go on talking his alert ears caught the buzzing of the muffled telephone bell in the adjoining room.\n\n“Please stand by for one moment,” he said, and stepped into the phone room.\n\n“What is it, Henry?” he inquired. “More dope from headquarters?”\n\nThe telephone operator grinned. “Headquarters—my neck!” he grunted. “Just another dame callin’ up to rave about that voice of yours. Wants to know if you’ll send her an autographed picture of yourself.”\n\nDave Cates shrugged. It almost seemed that nature atoned for her lavishness in giving him a golden voice by crediting him with a bulldog jaw, a wide mouth, and a pug nose that sported five freckles. His eyes, level and blue, were his only redeeming feature.\n\nIt had been his eyes as well as his voice that had induced Captain Henessey to recommend that he be put on the pay roll as the first radio officer the department ever had.\n\nBut there it ended. Cates longed for the life of the cop on the beat, but his physical qualifications were below standard. In his heart he kept locked away an ideal of romance, but it hardly seemed likely that the ideal would ever materialize. They all liked his voice, but they turned away from his face.\n\n“Tell ’em to go jump a fence,” said Officer Cates. “This is no picture gallery we’re running here, nor is it a lonely hearts department. If those babies think they’re kidding me, they’re tuning in on the wrong station.”\n\nHe turned on his heel to go back to the broadcasting room, but paused as the phone rang again. Henry plugged in and took the message, then spun around in his chair and jerked off his “ear muffs.”\n\n“Some guy just called in to say if you didn’t lay off broadcastin’ you’d get bumped,” he said excitedly. “He⸺”\n\n“You’re kidding!”\n\n“The hell I am! He meant business, too, by the way he sounded.”\n\nYoung Officer Cates wasn’t particularly surprised. The code warnings had proved very successful in producing quick action on the part of the police and checking activities on the part of the criminals. It was only natural to suppose that, sooner or later, the warning would come.\n\n“The son of a gun!” he said slowly.\n\nBut he was not afraid. The sudden tenseness of his stocky body was merely the tenseness of a fighter before the gong. Some excitement might even develop out of this warning. An anticipatory glint appeared in the blue eyes.\n\n“The son of a gun!” Cates repeated. “Tell him to go jump two fences, Henry.”\n\nCasually Cates sauntered back to the microphone.\n\n“Police division of station KYK still going strong,” he said lightly. “It gives me great pleasure at this moment to acknowledge a phone call. This call just came in from an unknown gentleman who suggested that we stop broadcasting, while the stopping was good. I don’t like to disappoint the gentleman, but this division will continue to be on the air at the same time every night.”\n\nAnd so was the challenge of organized gangdom caught up and hurled back by a stocky, freckle-faced officer, who was more than willing to prove himself.\n\nCalmly he continued with the various messages. That he was no longer broadcasting in code, the police knew by his utterance of the word, “classified.”\n\nThese items were numerous. A lady had lost a tan-and-white collie dog somewhere between 13th Street and Southland Road, and would pay a substantial reward to any one returning the dog.\n\nA young man in a gray suit was now at headquarters awaiting identification. The young man was a victim of amnesia—didn’t know his own name or anything about himself.\n\nFinally, some heartless crook had stolen the pocketbook of an old man who was on his way from Maine to California to see his dying daughter. Any small contributions that would help to put the old man on his journey would be welcomed.\n\nThen Dave Cates glanced at the electric clock on the wall, above the green light.\n\n“And so this brings to an end our broadcast for this evening,” he concluded. “This is the police division of station KYK signing off at exactly eight thirty. Good night.”\n\nCates stuffed the sheets of paper into his pocket, lighted a cigarette, and went out to the elevator.\n\nThe elevator boy grinned admiringly. “Evenin’, Mr. Cates,” he said. “I heard you broadcast three nights ago. Gee, it must be swell to be an announcer, and have nothin’ to do but talk.”\n\nOfficer Cates grinned. “It might be worse, Billy,” he admitted. “Yes, it might be a whole lot worse.” To himself he added, “And it might be a heck of a lot better.”\n\nCates emerged from the elevator at the ground floor and went into the street, moving with the brisk step that characterized him. At once, a nattily dressed young man detached himself from the passing throng and stepped up to Cates. The young man’s right hand was casually thrust into his topcoat pocket.\n\n“Don’t make any funny moves or you’ll get drilled,” he cautioned, low voiced. “See that car at the curb? Well, hop into it.”\n\nThe little announcer stiffened with the chill that went over him. Evidently they were losing no time in making good their threats. Cates knew it would do no good to make a break, for the young man would shoot instantly and melt away in the crowd. His eyes, dark and menacing, gave that warning.\n\nCates eyed him steadily. “What car?” he asked, trying to gain time.\n\n“You know what car!” snarled the gunman. “This green limousine here. Get goin’.”\n\nOfficer Cates shrugged. He stepped toward the car. Then a miraculous thing happened.\nCHAPTER II: PRACTICING FOR DEATH\n\nA girl who had been anxiously studying the face of every man coming out of the building hurried to Dave Cates. All in a second he saw the radiant smile on her face, caught a glimpse of her lovely, hazel eyes and the infinite grace of her step. She hesitated not a second but came directly to him, a charming little figure, a bit shorter than himself. To his utter stupefaction she threw both arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips. Then quickly she took his arm and led him into the crowd.\n\nSo astounded was Cates that he didn’t notice the way she kept between him and the gunman, who had recognized the girl and was scowling, baffled. Cates didn’t even stop to wonder why the gunman didn’t shoot.\n\n“Well, for the love of Mother Machree!” he stammered, completely at sea. “Are you an angel or have you got the wrong guy?”\n\nShe glanced up at him, but made no answer. White of face from the strain of the ordeal through which she had just passed, she piloted him toward headquarters, four blocks distant.\n\nGradually the radio cop recovered his wits. “Sister, I don’t mean to be too curious,” he apologized, “but there’s a little too much static in the old dome for me to get this thing right. How’d you happen to step in there when you did? Were you wise to them? And why didn’t that guy shoot?”\n\nStill no answer, only a pleading look from the hazel eyes. Then swiftly she turned and hurried away.\n\n“Hold on,” called Cates, concerned. “I haven’t learned a thing yet. Here, wait a minute, sister!”\n\nBut she did not heed. For a moment he was tempted to overtake her and demand an explanation, then decided against it. Whoever she was, she had known there would be an attempt on his life.\n\nBut why should she run a risk in saving him? The question fairly shouted for an answer, but gratitude would not allow him to ask what she very evidently did not want to answer.\n\nThere were other things, too. Officer Cates became aware that his heart was beating at twice its usual tempo. Faint perfume still trailed about him, and there was a cool fragrance on his lips that had never been there before.\n\n“Right on the old pan, she kissed me,” Cates murmured in awed tones. “Right on the old pan, and I let her get away without even finding out her name. Well, what do you know?”\n\nFor such was the make-up of the stocky announcer that the kiss of an unknown girl could concern him more than the threat of a gunman. Sighing profoundly, his alert eyes dreamy, he proceeded on to headquarters.\n\nCaptain Henessey, granite-jawed, shrewd-eyed veteran, looked up interestedly.\n\n“Hello, Dave,” he said, and leaned back in his chair. “What’s all this you broadcast about being pegged?”\n\nCates nodded.\n\n“That’s right, captain,” he confirmed. “They almost got me, too. They would have if it hadn’t been for the cutest little jane I ever saw in my life. Honest, she was about so high, and she was all dolled up like a million with a fur around her neck and sort of a satin dress and little high-heel shoes. And say, captain, you’d ought to see her eyes. The way⸺”\n\n“That’s enough,” interrupted Captain Henessey, recognizing the symptoms. “You’re giving no public address now, lad. Confine yourself to the facts.”\n\nSo, as briefly as he could, the radio cop told his superior of the incident.\n\nCaptain Henessey rubbed at his ear and pondered. “H’m,” he said. “I’d like to talk with that girl, Dave. Maybe she knows something about this gang situation.”\n\n“How does it stand now?”\n\nThe captain’s mouth was grim. “Bad enough. Here we go and drag Margolo into court on a murder charge and a lily-livered jury throw the case out because they say the evidence isn’t conclusive enough.” His big fist banged down on the desk. “Evidence—hell! They would have had enough evidence if they hadn’t been scared of the gang’s power.\n\n“Now Big Ed’ll be giving us the horse laugh, and he’ll pull more stuff than ever. The first thing he’ll probably do is to go after McGuirk, and we’ll have a gang war on our hands.\n\n“But I don’t mind McGuirk so much. He could be worse. It’s Margolo I want to get, and I’d give a lot for a man who would see him in a shooting and then have the nerve to go into court and testify.”\n\nDave Cates gazed ruefully at the bulletin board. Now more than ever he wished he could qualify for active service.\n\n“Margolo is sore because McGuirk’s cutting into his business, isn’t he?” he asked.\n\nCaptain Henessey nodded. “Yes, and that means there’ll be more shooting.”\n\n“Where does Margolo usually hang out?”\n\n“Well, he spends a lot of his time at the Salon Quintesse, that road house out by Syndicate Park. He’s got an apartment in the new Donahue block, too, but I don’t think either of those places is his official headquarters.\n\n“Margolo’s a cagy cuss and he keeps moving from place to place. No telling where he’s located now.”\n\nThe captain looked suddenly at the small figure of his radio announcer. “What does this chap look like who pegged you?” he asked.\n\nCates described the man at some length.\n\n“Sounds like ‘Slim’ Fiske of Margolo’s crew,” commented the captain. “By the way, Dave, what are you going to do about this threat? Take a little lay-off?”\n\nThe radio cop drew himself to his full height of five feet seven.\n\n“Cut it out, captain,” he said.\n\nCaptain Henessey hid a grin. It was Cates’ first test, and the lad had met it as the captain expected.\n\n“Just as you say,” he answered. “But for a while I’ll assign a man to cover you when you come out after each night’s broadcast. Now run along. I’m busy.”\n\nAs Dave Cates walked up the stairs to the top floor barracks where he slept, he considered things. Not a doubt that he was in for trouble if he continued to announce. Even with an officer covering his exits, they’d get him sooner or later. This was not a pleasant prospect—particularly since he had looked into a pair of hazel eyes and had received the soft touch of red lips. Not at all a pleasant prospect to contemplate.\n\nNo, he intended both to live and to stay on his job, and the only way to combine the two things was to get the gangsters before they got him. Dave Cates stopped short, rubbing at his bulldog jaw.\n\nHe’d considered this idea before, of course—for what young man connected in any way with a police department hasn’t dreamed of putting a stop to the most flagrant lawlessness in his vicinity?—but hitherto he had never considered it seriously. Now, under the menace to his life, the thought was no longer audacious.\n\nTurning the matter over in his mind Cates went to his locker and took from it his shoulder holster and the big police gun. He adjusted the holster under his left arm, cast a casual glance at the sleeping forms of men who were to go on duty with the midnight shift, and went into the shower room.\n\nA long mirror was there. Dave Cates stood before it. From a lounging position he yanked out the gun and leveled it. A dozen times he did this, and then practiced drawing from all sorts of positions, reclining, walking, bending almost double.\n\n“Getting faster at it, anyway,” he told himself.\n\nThis was his nightly habit and had been since he became radio officer. He was still young enough to thrill to this secret practice; and yet old enough to realize that some day the acquired deftness and speed might stand him in good stead.\n\nEvery afternoon he practiced assiduously at the short-range targets down in the basement of the building. Officer Cates of the wave-length squad was not only very quick on the draw, but very adept at knocking the neck off a bottle fifty paces distant.\n\nTwenty minutes later he put on an old topcoat, drew a cap well down over his eyes, and went out into the street to catch a southbound car.\n\nEverybody seemed to think that Big Ed Margolo would go after McGuirk at once.\n\nDave Cates thought differently. “Margolo’s no dumb-bell,” he mused, glancing at a youth of about his own size and general appearance who sat across the car. “He’ll figure they’re watching him close and lay off for a time. In that case I’ll watch him closer than ever.”\n\nCates observed that the other occupant of the car was regarding him with more than passing interest. “Humph. Wonder who that guy is? He’s givin’ me the once-over like he wanted to know my family history.”"
