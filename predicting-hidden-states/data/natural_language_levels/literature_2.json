Some years before, two beavers, whose house had been destroyed by the Indians, set out on a journey to found a new town. They travelled along at their leisure, living upon the tender bark of the low and cotton-wood shoots, which they found in great abundance, and looking for a home. They found no place to suit them for a great many days. One stream was too swift, another too slow; another was subject to great freshets, as was plainly shown by the heaps of driftwood which lay piled on the banks, and the great logs in the bed of the stream.\n\nAt last, however, after travelling till they were tired and almost discouraged, they came one morning to the banks of a large and clear brook. Willows and cotton-wood grew all around it, there were no signs of men anywhere about, and just in the shadiest, pleasantest place there was a long reach of still water.\n\n\"This will suit very nicely,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"I have not seen such a pleasant place since we left home.\"\n\n\"No place can ever be to me like that old home,\" said Mrs. Beaver, sighing. \"I do not feel any courage at all about beginning to build in this new, strange stream.\"\n\n\"O, you must not be downhearted,\" returned Mr. Beaver, cheerily. \"We shall soon have a family about us again, and every thing will be as pleasant as before our misfortunes commenced. See how handily those young cotton-woods grow for our dam. We can never be at a loss for food here, as you know was sometimes the case in our old home. We ought to be thankful also that it is early spring instead of fall. We have all the summer before us in which to work, and I can see no reason why we should not have a very nice, pleasant home before winter comes upon us.\"\n\nMrs. Beaver sighed again, but she reflected that there is no use in crying for what cannot be helped; and as she really loved her husband, she did not wish to discourage him by fretting, so she put on a cheerful face, and set to work with a good will.\n\nIt was indeed needful to keep up a stout heart, for the two beavers had a deal of hard work before them. Their first care was to build up a dam to shut in the water and make a pond. They began operations by cutting down a great many young trees about as thick as a man's wrist. Then they cut off the branches, and stripped them of their bark, which they piled away in heaps for food in winter. With these trees and branches they built their dam, sticking the ends down into the mud at the bottom of the stream, weaving them firmly together with smaller sticks, long grass, and reeds, and plastering them neatly over with mud, so that the dam, when done, was quite water-tight. It was about ten feet wide at the bottom, and sloped to two feet at the top, and was so long as to go clear across the stream, and a good way up on either bank. All this was done at night, for beavers prefer to work at night, and sleep or play in the daytime.\n\nYou may perhaps wonder how the two beavers contrived to do so much work, but they knew beforehand just what they wished to accomplish, and they had tools well adapted to their uses. Their sharp teeth were their saws and axes, wherewith to cut down the trees, and strip them of their bark, while their paws and their broad, flat tails served for hoes and trowels, to dig up the mud, and spread it for mortar. *\n\n\n* Some say the beavers never use their tails for trowels.\n\nWhen Mrs. Beaver saw how nicely the work went on, she was quite cured of her low spirits, and by fall she had almost forgotten that she had ever lived anywhere else.\n\nBy the time cold weather came they had quit, finished their dam, and had also built themselves a very nice house. It was made of branches piled up cross-ways, and mixed with mud and stones, with a roof in the shape of a dome, and it was so strong and tight that no rain or snow could get through it. In this house they made very neat little beds of dried grass, and here they lived very happily, sleeping and playing, and eating the nice bark and roots which they had stored up in the fall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nIDLERS DRIVEN OUT.\n\n\nIN the spring, Mr. Beaver took a very long journey, as beavers are used to do at that time of the year; and when he came home he found that his wife had a nice little family of five young ones, big enough to run about and help in the work of the house. That summer two more pairs of beavers came and set up housekeeping on the banks of the stream. They were very good-natured, helpful people, willing to do their share of all the work which was going on, and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver gave them a warm welcome, showing them where the best bark grew, and where the white lily roots were sweetest, for beavers are usually very polite and kind to one another.\n\nThe next year there were many young beavers frisking about the dam and in the water, and in the course of time the colony grew to be a very large one. They had not been disturbed by hunters or trappers; they always had plenty to eat; they were kind to one another, and upon the whole, they were very happy.\n\nHowever, nobody gets through the world without some trouble, and the beavers had their share. One year three or four of the young beavers refused to work at the dam, or at bringing in bark and branches for food. They did not like rooting in the mud, they said, or gnawing at branches till their jaws ached. They were made perfect slaves of, and they would stand it no longer. And with that they set up their backs, and showed their teeth, and tried to look very grand and independent, but they only succeeded in looking cross. Their fathers and mothers talked to them kindly about their faults, and then tried punishing them, but all did no good. They were just as idle and naughty as before.\n\nWhen the other beavers saw this, they called a council to consult as to what was to be done; and after talking the matter over, they agreed that unless the idle beavers came to their senses, and were willing to do their fair share of the work, they must be driven from the village, and live by themselves as they best could.\n\nThe idlers said they did not care; they could live well enough anywhere. So the old beavers drove them out of the village, and would not let them come back any more. They also warned the other young beavers to have nothing to do with them in any way, for they were wise enough to know how soon good manners are spoiled by bad company.\n\nSo these idlers went away and lived in the woods, not very far from the beaver dam. They were too lazy and stupid to build nice houses, so they just scratched holes in the ground to sleep in, and spent their whole time in doing nothing at all, which is just the hardest work in the world when one has too much of it.\n\nIt was about two years after the idlers were driven from the village that Binney was born. As soon as he was able to notice anything, he found himself lying on a nice bed of hay with three other little beavers just like himself. They all had bright black eyes, short stout legs, very long strong fore-feet, and hind-feet webbed like those of a goose, having long claws, with which they soon learned to comb their soft fur, and keep it in nice order. They had also broad, flat tails, shaped like a mason's trowel, and clothed with scales instead of hair. They were merry little things, and soon began to have fine games of play with the other little beavers in the town. With these little friends they swam in the pond, dived from the dam, and ran about the banks of the stream all day long.\n\nBut they soon found out that life was not to be all play. As soon as they were big enough, their mothers began to teach them to work. First they learned to bring grass and straw for the nest, holding the load under their chins with one paw, and walking with the other three. Then they were taught to dive for mud and moss at the bottom of the pond, and at last to gnaw down twigs and sticks for the dam.\n\nAt first Binney thought it would be a fine thing to work like a grown-up beaver, but he soon found out that work is not as easy as play. After a time he began to be idle, and would slip away from his work to play in the woods on the bank of the stream. His mother talked to him very kindly about his fault, and told him what would be the consequence of itâ€”that he would be driven from the town, and forced to live in the woods, where he would often be cold and hungry, and where none of his friends and relations would visit him, or speak to him.\n\nBinney promised to be more industrious, and for a time was very good; but he pretty soon forgot his loving mother's advice and grew idle again, and the others began to look coldly upon him, and to forbid their children to play with him, for it is thought very mean and disgraceful in a beaver to be idle.\n\nOne day he was hanging about in the woods, whither he had been sent for some birch twigs with which to mend the house. His was not a hard or disagreeable task, for the twigs were small and tender, and the bark was sweet and pleasant to the taste; but Binney had learned to hate the very name of work. Still he did not dare to return without the twigs which he had been sent for, as his father had been angry with him that very morning, and said he would punish him severely unless he did better.\n\nSo he was hanging about the woods, as I have said, feeling cross and low spirited, wishing that his work was done, and yet unable to make up his mind to go about it. All at once, as he walked along, he came upon a beaver whom he had never met before."
