      "context": "The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered Subutai and Jebe to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.",

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.\n\nImplications:\n"

Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.\n\nImplications:\n"

(Lake Baikal and ocean were called tenggis by the Mongols. However, it seems that if they had meant to call Genghis tenggis they could have said, and written, \"Tenggis Khan\", which they did not.) Zhèng (Chinese: 正) meaning \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\", would have received the Mongolian adjectival modifier -s, creating \"Jenggis\", which in medieval romanization would be written \"Genghis\". It is likely that the 13th century Mongolian pronunciation would have closely matched \"Chinggis\".\n\nImplications:\n"

Later came The Clouded Yellow (1951) and Payroll (1961), both of which feature more extensive scenes filmed in the city. The 1971 film Get Carter was shot on location in and around Newcastle and offers an opportunity to see what Newcastle looked like in the 1960s and early 1970s. The city was also backdrop to another gangster film, the 1988 film noir thriller Stormy Monday, directed by Mike Figgis and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting and Sean Bean.\n\nImplications:\n"

      "context": "In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.",

      "context": "A term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]",

He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life. Others had translated the Bible into German, but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine. When he was criticised for inserting the word \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, he replied in part: \"[T]he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it. For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine, namely, that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law. ...

His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier, but where Céloron had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore. He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. Marin constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French (whom he accused of killing and eating his father). Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf, he threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.\n\nImplications:\n"

This indicates the V&A is a renowned and globally respected cultural landmark in its field.\n\n2. Founded in 1852 by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the V&A has a rich history that places it among the oldest and most historic museums in the world. Its founding by a monarch and a royal figure speaks to the institution's prestigious and prestigious origins.\n\n3. The V&A is based in the Brompton area of London, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The area is often referred to as \"Albertopolis\" in honour of Prince Albert, who was closely associated with many significant institutions in the district, including the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, and the Royal Albert Hall. This suggests the V&A is part of a larger concentration of cultural and scientific institutions in the area.\n\n4. The museum is an independent body, sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This implies the V&A has a high level of autonomy in its operations and governance, yet it still operates within the broader framework of the UK's cultural and governmental structures.\n\n5. Since its establishment in 2001, the V&A has been free to enter for all. This decision by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made the V&A accessible to all members of society, regardless of their ability to pay, which implies a strong commitment to universal accessibility and the public enjoyment of culture.\n\n6. The V&A's collection spans a broad array of decorative arts and design objects from around the world and across time. This indicates the museum's mission is to be encyclopedic in its scope, representing as many diverse styles, periods, and cultures as possible within its vast collection.\n\n7. As a national institution, the V&A's work likely carries a significant responsibility to preserve, exhibit, and research objects of cultural and historical significance. The museum serves both as an educational and inspirational resource for the public.\n\n8. The V&A's presence in central London allows for easy public access and contributes to the city's cultural vibrancy and reputation as a global hub for art, history, and culture. This suggests the museum contributes to the city's tourist industry and cultural identity. \n\n9. Given its large size and free access, the V&A is a popular destination for both locals and international tourists. This high level of footfall implies a significant economic importance to the area, especially as a contributor to the local tourism industry.\n\n10. Finally, as a public institution, the V&A likely influences public perception and understanding of decorative arts and design. Its exhibitions, research, and public programs likely shape how people appreciate and comprehend these disciplines.",

The Huguenots were drawn towards the Dutch Republic as an attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes due to its Calvinist values and financial wealth.\n3. French-speaking Calvinist churches were also established in the Dutch Republic as a result of the Huguenot community.\n4. The Netherlands became a hub for Huguenots seeking a safe haven and to practice their religion after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\n5. The Dutch Republic's position as a strong opponent of Louis XIV and his policies, as well as its tolerance of religious diversity, attracted many foreign religious minorities seeking refuge, such as the Huguenots.\n6. The Huguenots, being Calvinist, found a favorable environment in the Netherlands where they could practice their religion without persecution.\n7. William III of Orange, who later became King of England, played a crucial role in defending the Netherlands against Louis XIV's aggression and in creating a safer environment for Huguenots to settle in the country.\n8. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes had significant effects on the religious and political dynamics of Europe during the time period, causing political strife and forcing religious minorities to seek refuge.\n9. The Dutch Republic, with its strong Calvinist values and financial power, emerged as a major player in the European political landscape during this time.\n10.

The Philo Greco-Roman Club, to which some members of the \"synagogue of the Tyrians\" belonged, met in a building in the Byzantine neighborhood of Neorion, and hosted many of the state's leaders in 1476. All this brought the Sephardic community into contact with elite members of the Christian minority in Rhodes, at a time when the republic was undergoing a traumatic experience—its final confrontation with Venice.\n\nImplications:\n1. The presence of prominent Jews such as Meir Caro and Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno in Rhodes allowed the Smiths, who were part of the \"synagogue of the Tyrians,\" to meet and interact with notable members of the Jewish community.\n2. The Philo Greco-Roman Club, which the Smiths joined, was attended by leaders of the Christian community, and served as a platform for networking and forming connections between various groups in Rhodes.\n3. The fact that the Philo Greco-Roman Club was located in the Byzantine neighborhood of Neorion suggests that the city had a mix of different cultural and religious influences, providing opportunities for integration and interaction among its diverse populations.\n4. The importance of the Philo Greco-Roman Club as a center for leaders of the state implies that it had a significant role in politics and governance during the time, as it hosted many prominent figures.\n5. The encounter between the Sephardic community and elite members of the Christian minority in Rhodes reflects the complex interplay of different religious and cultural groups within the broader society of Rhodes.\n6. The meeting of the Smiths with influential figures from the Jewish community and the Philo Greco-Roman Club highlights the dynamic and interconnected nature of the social network in Rhodes, where people from different backgrounds came together for discussion and interaction.\n7. The final confrontation with Venice, as a traumatic event for Rhodes, may have further impacted the relationships and alliances among the different groups, possibly leading to a restructuring of the social and political landscape.\n8. The association of the Smiths with the \"synagogue of the Tyrians\" demonstrates the presence of a significant Jewish population in Rhodes during the time period, suggesting a thriving Jewish community.\n9. The involvement of the Sephardic community with influential members of the Christian minority may have led to mutual understanding and respect, as well as an exchange of ideas and knowledge between the two groups.\n10. The experience of the Smiths attending the meetings of the Philo Greco-Roman Club and hosting leaders from various groups in Rhodes provides insights into the social interactions and cultural exchanges that took place during this period, shedding light on the diversity of the city.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nAlso, a virtual reality apparatus allows visitors to take a brief visual tour of what space might look like from another planet. Computer and holography technicians program all the scenes and effects. It seems that the impact of the programmed experience is increased by the knowledge that it is real, not a fake, and will stand up to examination. Reality is almost meaningless for visitors who have been inside it: after walking through the installation, trying on the helmet and gloves, putting on the space suits, the visitors can run around on the surfaces of a planet without any real effort on their part, since they are suspended a few feet off the floor. The computer can put out a rainbow of color if one enters a four-dimensional space, and magnify a particular area so it becomes a strong hologram to photograph.\n\nImplications:\n1. The virtual reality apparatus at the space exhibit creates a convincing and interactive experience for visitors, allowing them to visualize space and simulate the experience of exploring other planets.\n2. The computer and holography technicians involved in programming the scenes and effects ensure that the virtual reality environment is realistic and will withstand examination.\n3. The perceived authenticity and realism of the virtual reality experience increases the impact it has on visitors.\n4. Visitors to the space exhibit can immerse themselves in a simulated environment where they can explore different planets and experience the sensation of walking in space.\n5. The virtual reality helmet and gloves provide an immersive and interactive experience for the visitors, allowing them to feel like they are physically present in a space environment.\n6. The suspended surface on which visitors can run around on adds to the feeling of weightlessness and enhances the immersive experience.\n7. The computer technology can create dynamic and changing environments, including the ability to explore four-dimensional spaces and produce strong holograms to photograph.\n8. The exhibit offers a unique opportunity for visitors to learn and experience aspects of space exploration that are otherwise impossible in a real-world setting.\n9. The virtual reality apparatus enables visitors to explore a variety of environments and scenarios within space, providing a comprehensive understanding of the space environment.\n10. The exhibit demonstrates the power of technology in creating realistic and impactful experiences, transforming traditional learning into an immersive and engaging activity.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nThe preceding images are meant as intuitive introductions to the three-dimensional space we know. Of course, with the modern advent of space travel, these two-dimensional images of Earth are becoming much less useful. As Huygens confirmed in the seventeenth century, the Earth is not flat but spherical. It is easy for us to comprehend this – by travelling on planes. But even so, the traveller can still only experience the world from two dimensions. To really experience three dimensions, you have to live within the space itself. You have to become familiar with the beauty, randomness and strangeness of that space – as New Brunswickers have been.\n\nImplications:\n1. The development of space travel and the modern ability to physically explore space has made it increasingly important to understand three-dimensional space beyond the two-dimensional images we commonly see.\n2. The Earth's spherical shape has been confirmed through space travel, specifically by missions such as the Huygens mission in the seventeenth century.\n3. Despite the possibility to experience the Earth from the perspective of three dimensions, individuals can still only experience it from a two-dimensional perspective, primarily through virtual and imaging technologies.\n4. In order to truly understand and appreciate the complexity and uniqueness of three-dimensional space, individuals must immerse themselves within it and live in that environment.\n5. The ability to become familiar with the beauty, randomness, and strangeness of three-dimensional space, as experienced by New Brunswickers, highlights the importance of direct exposure and exploration.\n6. The realization of the Earth's three-dimensional nature emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world in which we live.\n7.

An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks has run time 2O(√(n log(n))) for graphs with n vertices.\n\nImplications:\n"

Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.\n\nImplications:\n"

The involvement of Rep. Joe Barton and Ed Whitfield, both with regulatory oversight in climate research, indicates that their actions are politically motivated.\n\n3. Sherwood Boehlert's criticism of Barton's investigation and his suggestion that it could be part of a larger pattern of intimidation for scientists, suggests that there may be a broader trend of attempts to undermine climate research.\n\n4. The request for personal information about the scientists' finances and careers might be seen as an attempt to discredit them or shift focus from the science to their personal lives.\n\n5. The National Academy of Sciences' decision to set up a special investigation to examine the claims made by Barton indicates that the request for records was considered important and significant.\n\n6. The National Research Council's report supporting the basic accuracy of Mann, Bradley, and Hughes' research suggests that there might be limited consensus among scientists on climate change topics.\n\n7. Mann, Bradley, and Hughes' letter to Nature following the Barton investigation shows that they view their work as ongoing and suggesting the need for more research to improve their conclusions.\n\n8. The statement from the National Research Council confirms that there were some statistical issues in the original article, but that they did not significantly alter the data or conclusions presented.\n\n9. Mann, Bradley, and Hughes' continued research into climate change acknowledges the importance of the subject and the ongoing nature of scientific inquiry.\n\n10. The motives behind the Barton investigation remain unclear and may suggest a larger, political agenda.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nMann was honored on March 19, 2008, at the second annual Science & Public Policy Award of the Science & Public Policy Institute, a conservative think tank based in Maryland. This award went to him for his role in compiling the Mann, Bradley, and Hughes 1998 chart, which the Institute claims \"confirmed that global warming is occurring, but more importantly disproved the idea that this problem was unprecedented, showing a notable global temperature spike in the 20th century.\" Opponents of this idea have expressed deep concern about the end of the Little Ice Age causing a rapid increase in global temperatures, and this award is seen as directly counter to such opinions.\n\nImplications:\n\n1. The award from the Science & Public Policy Institute represents recognition for Mann's work in compiling the Mann, Bradley, and Hughes 1998 chart and challenging the idea of unprecedented global warming.\n\n2. The award may be viewed as an endorsement of the validity of Mann's research, and a counterpoint to scientific claims of a rapid increase in global temperatures at the end of the Little Ice Age.\n\n3. The award could be interpreted as reflecting a political agenda that supports the positions of the Science & Public Policy Institute, who are a conservative think tank.\n\n4. Mann's award may be seen as controversy-inducing, both in the scientific community and in broader political circles.\n\n5. The Science & Public Policy Institute's mission is to provide conservative perspectives on science and public policy, so their selection of Mann for this award is likely to align with their policy goals.\n\n6. Opposition to the idea of an unprecedented global warming spike has expressed deep concern, implying that it's a view that needs addressing or clarifying.\n\n7. Mann's work, the award, and the associated controversy shed light on the importance of scientific research and its impact on public opinion and policy.\n\n8. The Science & Public Policy Institute's actions may be motivated by a desire to support conservative ideologies rather than scientific consensus.\n\n9. It's possible that the award was a deliberate attempt to influence public opinion and discredit Mann's research by associating it with a political agenda.\n\n10. The award serves as an example of how scientific research can become politicized, and highlights the need for scientists to remain transparent about their methods and findings to maintain credibility.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nFollowing their loss to the Patriots, the Broncos headed to Sports Authority Field for their Week 13 home opener against the Miami Dolphins. In the first quarter, the Broncos drew first blood as RB Ronnie Hillman got a 1-yard TD run. However, the Dolphins responded with QB Ryan Tannehill completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Brian Hartline. In the second quarter, Miami took the lead with Tannehill completing a 57-yard TD pass to TE Jordan Cameron. The Broncos answered back with QB Peyton Manning completing a 50-yard TD pass to WR Wes Welker, along with RB C. J. Anderson getting a 2-yard TD run. The Dolphins took a 24-21 lead in the third quarter with kicker Dan Carpenter nailing a 48-yard field goal. Denver responded in the fourth quarter as Anderson got a 37-yard TD run to put the game out of reach. The Dolphins tried to come back in the final seconds, but Carpenter's 65-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright and bounced off the ground for the win. With the win, the Broncos improved to 9-3, and clinched a playoff berth for the 11th straight season. Also, the Broncos tied the team record for wins in a season with 10. Additionally, the Broncos became the fourth team in NFL history to reach 10 wins by the middle of the season (along with the 1974 Dolphins, 2013 49ers, and 2016 Eagles).\n\nImplications:\n\n1. The Broncos' victory over the Miami Dolphins in Week 13 was their 9th win of the season.\n2. Denver won their 11th straight playoff berth, continuing a long-standing streak.\n3. The team tied their own record for the most wins in a season (10).\n4. The Broncos became the fourth NFL team in history to achieve 10 wins by the middle of the season.\n5. The victory provided the Broncos a significant advantage going into the remainder of their season.\n6. It was a notable achievement for the team's fans, who got to witness the team's historic accomplishments.\n7. Peyton Manning's performance, including the 50-yard TD pass to Wes Welker, boosted his legacy within the franchise.\n8. The Broncos effectively staved off an opponent known for their speed and playmaking ability, showing the team's resiliency and tactical ability.\n9. In the 4th quarter, Denver's C.J. Anderson became the focus of the offensive strategy, providing crucial momentum for the team.\n10. The game showcased Peyton Manning's ability to step up in high-pressure situations, demonstrating his leadership qualities and overall performance as a quarterback.",

          "text": "1. Jacksonville's tax base was insufficient, leading to difficulties in funding essential public services and infrastructure.\n2. Unincorporated suburbs were unable to provide residents with essential municipal services like sewage and building code enforcement.\n3. In 1958, a study was conducted to recommend the annexation of outlying communities to address these issues and create a larger tax base.\n4. Despite the study's recommendations, residents in unincorporated suburbs repeatedly rejected annexation plans between 1960 and 1965 through six referendums.\n\nJustification:\n- The passage describes the city's tax base decline, indicating insufficient funding for public services.\n- It mentions that unincorporated suburbs lacked access to necessary municipal services.\n- The 1958 study proposed annexing communities to address these problems.\n- Residents' persistent rejection of annexation plans suggests a lack of support for such changes.\n\nWhat if the people who lived in the unincorporated suburbs were left behind in this way?\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nWhat are some scenarios where these gaps have closed?\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nThe passage does not provide specific information about the people who lived in the unincorporated suburbs and how they were left behind in this way.\n\nPossible ways this could have happened:\n- The city of Jacksonville may have lacked the political will or resources to address the issues in the unincorporated suburbs.\n- The people in the unincorporated suburbs may have actively opposed annexation or the city's efforts to address their needs.\n- The city's policies and programs may not have effectively reached or benefited residents in the unincorporated suburbs.\n\nPotential scenarios where these gaps have closed:\n- A concerted effort by the city to work with the residents in the unincorporated suburbs to address their needs.\n- The city may have initiated programs or policies that specifically targeted the needs of these communities, leading to improved services and infrastructure.\n- Changes in the political landscape or leadership may have facilitated the closing of these gaps.\n- The growth and development of the unincorporated suburbs could have led to changes in their demographics and needs, making them more compatible with the services and infrastructure offered by the city.\n\nList the implications of city of Jacksonville annexing unincorporated suburbs.\n\nImplications of the city of Jacksonville annexing unincorporated suburbs:\n1. Increased tax base: Annexation could provide a larger tax base for the city, which would help fund essential public services and infrastructure improvements.\n2. Improved municipal services: With annexation, residents in the unincorporated suburbs would gain access to municipal services like sewage, building code enforcement, and improved road infrastructure.\n3. Growth and development: Annexation could lead to increased development and investment in the unincorporated suburbs, as residents would have access to city services and infrastructure improvements.\n4. Potential conflict: Annexation could lead to conflicts and tensions between residents of the incorporated and unincorporated areas, as residents may have different needs and preferences for services and development.\n5. Political dynamics: Annexation could alter the political dynamics of the city and surrounding areas, as different neighborhoods may gain or lose influence depending on their population, demographics, and political power.\n\nWould the unincorporated suburbs gain services in both physical proximity and time to reach?\n\nWould they require subsidies?\n\nIf the city of Jacksonville annexed the unincorporated suburbs, would services have been available immediately, or would there be a lag time?\n\nSome scenarios in which these gaps could have closed:\n1. Improved connectivity: Annexation could lead to improved road infrastructure and public transportation options, making it easier for residents in the unincorporated suburbs to access city services in a timely manner.\n2. Municipal services expansion: With the larger tax base resulting from annexation, the city could potentially expand its municipal services to better meet the needs of residents in the unincorporated suburbs.\n3. Collaboration between city and suburbs: The city and the unincorporated suburbs could work together to establish joint services and infrastructure, reducing the need for subsidies and providing faster access to services.\n4. Enhanced coordination: Annexation could facilitate better coordination between city services and the needs of the unincorporated suburbs, resulting in more efficient and effective service delivery.\n\nIf annexation happened suddenly and there was a lag, then there would be a period of time where services would be insufficient.\n\nTherefore, services in a city of Jacksonville annexing the unincorporated suburbs are not necessarily available immediately or at the same time as for people close to city centers.\n\nHowever, there may be a period of lag where some services may not be available or may be less efficient and effective for residents in the unincorporated suburbs.\n\nIn some cases, the city of Jacksonville may require subsidies or additional funding to support the annexed areas and provide the necessary services and infrastructure. The magnitude of these subsidies would depend on the specific needs of the areas and the city's overall budget.\n\nNo, there is a market failure gap there:\n\nPeople left behind, with no funding for services, and lacking in physical proximity to where services are provided. \n\nSo annexation requires two types of subsidies, or time gaps:\n\nThe cost of funding services for areas left behind by the city.\n\nThe cost of fast tracking funding for areas that are far away.\n\nBut it is still a single market failure, not three distinct issues or solutions.\n\nThe implications of city of Jacksonville annexing the unincorporated suburbs:\n\n1. Increased tax base: Annexation could provide a larger tax base for the city, which would help fund essential public services and infrastructure improvements.\n2. Improved municipal services: With annexation, residents in the unincorporated suburbs would gain access to municipal services like sewage, building code enforcement, and improved road infrastructure.\n3. Growth and development: Annexation could lead to increased development and investment in the unincorporated suburbs, as residents would have access to city services and infrastructure improvements.\n4. Potential conflict: Annexation could lead to conflicts and tensions between residents of the incorporated and unincorporated areas, as residents may have different needs and preferences for services and development.\n5. Political dynamics: Annexation could alter the political dynamics of the city and surrounding areas, as different neighborhoods may gain or lose influence depending on their population, demographics, and political power.",

NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C.

When a pathogen enters the body, it is recognized by immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which engulf and digest the pathogen. This process releases antigens, which are molecules that trigger an immune response. The immune system then produces antibodies, which are proteins that specifically target and neutralize the pathogen. Additionally, the immune system activates T cells, which are responsible for directly attacking infected cells and coordinating the immune response. Finally, the immune system also",

As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.\n\nImplications:\n"

In 1992, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan ruled by communist forces collapsed, and democratic Islamist elements of mujahdeen founded the Islamic State of Afghanistan. In 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic Islamist movement known as the Taliban rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of Afghanistan.\n\nImplications:\n"

OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged. The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.\n\nImplications:\n"

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.\n\nImplications:\n"

In the 9th, it formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia, but in the 10th century, it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire, flowing through Swabia, Franconia and Lower Lorraine. The mouths of the Rhine, in the county of Holland, fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states. The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years' War. The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route.\n\nImplications:\n"

Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions.

They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state. Fajnzylber et al.

It was a monumental feat for the \"Mongols\" (as they became known collectively). At a Khuruldai, a council of Mongol chiefs, Temüjin was acknowledged as \"Khan\" of the consolidated tribes and took the new title \"Genghis Khan\". The title Khagan was not conferred on Genghis until after his death, when his son and successor, Ögedei, took the title for himself and extended it posthumously to his father (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the Yuan dynasty). This unification of all confederations by Genghis Khan established peace between previously warring tribes and a single political and military force under Genghis Khan.\n\nImplications:\n"

In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance. However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms.

Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.\n\nImplications:\n"

A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.\n\nImplications:\n"

For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.\n\nImplications:\n"

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

A toned down version was adopted as the Social Charter at the 1989 Strasbourg European Council. The Social Charter declares 30 general principles, including on fair remuneration of employment, health and safety at work, rights of disabled and elderly, the rights of workers, on vocational training and improvements of living conditions. The Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation.\n\nImplications:\n"

A July 23, 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate.\n\nImplications:\n"

Ceramics from the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres are extensive, especially from the 18th and 19th centuries. The collection of 18th-century British porcelain is the largest and finest in the world. Examples from every factory are represented, the collections of Chelsea porcelain and Worcester Porcelain being especially fine. All the major 19th-century British factories are also represented. A major boost to the collections was the Salting Bequest made in 1909, which enriched the museum's stock of Chinese and Japanese ceramics.

In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group. However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced that it would discontinue ABC1 citing to the channel's inability to attain sustainable viewership.

The logo used in the television movie featuring the Eighth Doctor was an updated version of the logo used for the Third Doctor. The logo from 1973–80 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure. The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season. The logo used for the Ninth Doctor was slightly edited for the Tenth Doctor, but it retained the same general appearance. The logo used for the Eleventh Doctor had the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia placed to the right in 2012, but the same font remained, albeit with a slight edit to the texture every episode, with the texture relating to some aspect of the story. The logo for the Twelfth Doctor had the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia removed and the font was subtly altered, as well as made slightly larger. As of 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors, and the current Doctor Who logo is used for all merchandise relating to the current Doctor.\n\nImplications:\n"

In 1656, the plague killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain. The plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half. In 1709–13, a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700–21, Sweden v. Russia and allies) killed about 100,000 in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia. The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki, and claimed a third of Stockholm's population. Europe's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in Marseille.\n\nImplications:\n"

The Min system manages the placement of the Z-ring, ensuring that the chloroplast is cleaved more or less evenly. The protein MinD prevents FtsZ from linking up and forming filaments. Another protein ARC3 may also be involved, but it is not very well understood. These proteins are active at the poles of the chloroplast, preventing Z-ring formation there, but near the center of the chloroplast, MinE inhibits them, allowing the Z-ring to form.\n\nImplications:\n"

For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors. However, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power. Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover. This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement.[citation needed]\n\nImplications:\n"

Church founder John Wesley preferred that women serve as local preachers. He ordained his first woman deacon, Anna N. Harrison, in 1784, and his first woman preacher, Sarah Chedzoy, in 1786. He denied women \"the episcopal office\" until the twentieth century, but in other cases, he said they could \"authorize\" others to do tasks they wanted done, such as visiting widows and orphans. Wesley directed his female preachers, including Harriet Chang, to avoid preaching to mixed-gender congregations, until females, \"in the mass\", become \"qualified to attend to divine services as the men do\".\n\nImplications:\n1. The ordination of women faced controversy during the Great Awakening in the 18th century.\n2. Women have been ordaining themselves in some cases for centuries before the Methodist separation from the Church of England.\n3. John Wesley was open to the idea of women serving as local preachers.\n4. Wesley ordained his first woman deacon, Anna N. Harrison, in 1784, and his first woman preacher, Sarah Chedzoy, in 1786.\n5. Women were denied the episcopal office until the 20th century in the United Methodist Church.\n6. Wesley allowed women to authorize others to perform tasks, such as visiting widows and orphans.\n7. He advised his female preachers, including Harriet Chang, to avoid preaching to mixed-gender congregations until females were qualified to attend divine services like men.\n8. The ordination of women has faced opposition historically and continues to be a divisive topic within the Methodist Church.\n9. Wesley's approach to women's ordination demonstrates a willingness to integrate women into various aspects of the church, but with limitations in terms of specific roles and settings.\n10. The ordination of women in the United Methodist Church has evolved over time, with changes occurring in the 20th century, but still being met with various opinions and concerns within the denomination.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nUnited Methodist Church\nThe oldest church body still in existence in the United States, the United Church of Christ (UCC), had its origins in Puritanism, though it also has its roots in Reformed theology. The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, founded in 1767, organized as a separate denomination by German-speaking Protestant immigrants from the Evangelical Association of Jurisdiction in the Eberbach, Pennsylvania area of the United States. It was founded in the former colony of Pennsylvania by followers of Bishop Peter Scheder, a student of the teachings of John Amos Comenius, also known as Jan Amos Komenský. John Amos Comenius was a Moravian educator and theologian who became known as the Father of Modern Education in the Western world and was widely popular for his missionary work and development of a universal education system throughout the world for all. The United Methodist Church came into being in 1968 as the result of a merger of the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren, both descendants of small groups of immigrant Christians that had, over the course of the next 200 years, grown to become the second and fourth largest Protestant denominations in the US. Today, the US United Methodist Church is a descendant of the original church of John Wesley and the German Brethren in Christ. As of 2017, the total membership of the UMC worldwide is 12 million, making it the second largest protestant church in the world after the Evangelical Church of Germany.\n\nImplications:\n1. The United Church of Christ is the oldest church body in the United States.\n2. The UCC has its roots in Puritanism and Reformed theology.\n3. The Church of the United Brethren in Christ was founded by German-speaking Protestants in Pennsylvania in 1767.\n4. The United Methodist Church originated as the result of a merger in 1968 between the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren, both of which had their origins in small immigrant Christian groups.\n5. The Methodist Church and Evangelical United Brethren were part of the second and fourth largest Protestant denominations in the US at the time of their merger.\n6. The United Methodist Church is a descendant of both the original church of John Wesley and the German Brethren in Christ.\n7. The United Methodist Church has experienced growth and expansion over the centuries, making it the second largest protestant church in the world as of 2017.\n8. The combined membership of the United Methodist Church worldwide is 12 million, reflecting its significant presence and influence in the global religious landscape.",

During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.",

This recognition is typically carried out by specialized immune cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages.\n\nFinal answer: Recognition of a foreign substance (antigen) by the immune system\n\nQuestion: Topic: Immune system\nWhat is the role of the immune system in the human body?\nReasoning: The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from harmful pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances. Its primary role is to identify and eliminate these threats, while also maintaining a balance between the body's own cells and the foreign invaders.\n\nFinal answer: The role of the immune system in the human body is to protect against harmful pathogens and maintain a balance between the body's own cells and foreign invaders.",

ABC's ownership of multiple separate affiliates within the same market, such as WFTS-TV and WWSB in Tampa, provides the network with unique and direct access to a larger audience.\n2. The existence of these separately owned and operated affiliates suggests a high level of control and influence over the broadcasting landscape within their respective markets.\n3. This specialized control allows ABC to tailor content and programs specifically for the interests and preferences of the local audience, potentially leading to a better fit with market demands and needs.\n4. The example of Kansas City, Missouri demonstrates that the proximity and overlap between TV markets can create ambiguity and complexity in terms of determining market boundaries, which can impact signal reception and viewership for the affiliates.\n5. An analogous situation arises in Kansas City where there are separate ABC affiliates (KMBC-TV and KQTV) serving the same area, further emphasizing the network's control over the region's broadcast landscape.\n6. St. Joseph, Missouri is considered a separate market from Kansas City despite its proximity, indicating that the proximity of broadcast markets is not solely determined by geographical distance but can be influenced by a combination of factors, such as signal reception and Nielsen designations.\n7. The case of Sarasota, which is served by WWSB, highlights the potential need for additional transmitters or relay stations to extend the coverage and reach of a station, especially when its primary transmitter is located far from the target market.\n8. WPLG's interference with WTSP's signal in Tampa highlights the importance of transmitter placement and signal strength in ensuring the proper reception of a TV station's signal, as well as the need to account for potential interference from neighboring markets.\n9. The analog signal of WPLG was mentioned, but the passage does not provide any information about whether WPLG switched to a digital signal or not, so its effect on WTSP's coverage area in Tampa remains ambiguous.\nYou are an AI assistant.

It had a magnitude of 7.0 Mw and was centered approximately 25 kilometers (16 mi) west of Port-au-Prince, the capital city of Haiti. The earthquake caused widespread destruction and loss of life. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the official death toll was 222,570, with 300,000 injured and 1.5 million people left homeless.

It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable \"head\". Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.\n\nImplications:\n"

For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then ζ(1) would have a finite value. However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes. Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (Basel problem), due to Euler,\n\nImplications:\n"

But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward.

The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed.

This constant has come to be known as Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant, though its value was unknown in Newton's lifetime. Not until 1798 was Henry Cavendish able to make the first measurement of  using a torsion balance; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing  could allow one to solve for the Earth's mass given the above equation. Newton, however, realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion, his law of gravity had to be universal.
