          "text": "1.  \nGenghis Khan  \nThe Shah’s army was weakened by internal disputes and further by his choice to scatter his troops across various cities. This division proved critical to Khwarezmia’s defeats, as the Mongols, despite their exhaustion from the journey, were able to pick off isolated Khwarezmian groups instead of confronting the full army at once. The Mongols rapidly captured the town of Otrar through superior tactics. Genghis Khan then had most of the civilians massacred, enslaved the survivors, and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes as punishment for his deeds. As the battle concluded, the Shah escaped rather than give in to the Mongols. Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 20,000 soldiers, granting them two years to pursue the Shah, who would ultimately die mysteriously on a remote island in his realm.\n\n2.  \nGenghis Khan  \nRiven by internal conflicts and the Shah's strategy to split forces across different cities, Khwarezmia's army became vulnerable. This fragmentation enabled the Mongols, worn from travel, to defeat the Shah’s forces in smaller, divided segments. Otrar was quickly taken by the Mongols using their superior strategies. Genghis Khan responded with a brutal massacre of civilians, enslaved the rest, and ordered the grisly execution of Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes—all as retribution. Instead of surrendering, the Shah fled as his armies collapsed. Genghis Khan assigned Subutai and Jebe, with 20,000 troops and two years, to track him. The Shah’s fate was sealed when he died mysteriously on an isolated island within his own lands.\n\n3.  \nGenghis Khan  \nInternal rivalries and the Shah’s plan to disperse his army into smaller city garrisons left his forces divided—a weakness the Mongols exploited to devastating effect. Arriving after a long march, the Mongols could destroy Khwarezmia’s fragmented army in stages, never having to fight the entire force together. Otrar fell to them swiftly, thanks to cunning leadership and battlefield tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the slaughter of many townspeople, took the rest as slaves, and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes in revenge. As defeat loomed, the Shah escaped capture. Genghis Khan tasked Subutai and Jebe with 20,000 men—and gave them two years—to find the Shah, who ultimately died in ambiguous circumstances on a secluded island within his dominion.",

In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties). This view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens. The Court of Justice refused, but there are five large exceptions.",
      "completions": [

          "text": "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nUnder European Union law, Treaties and Regulations can have direct effect if they are clear, unconditional, and immediate. In contrast, Directives do not typically allow individual citizens to sue one another; they are mainly binding on member states. This is rooted in TFEU article 288, which states that Directives are directed at member states and let national authorities decide how to implement them. Often, Directives establish only minimum standards, while countries can set higher requirements. For example, although the Working Time Directive guarantees at least four weeks of paid holiday per year, most countries offer more in their national laws. According to the current interpretation by the Court of Justice, individuals can only base claims on national laws made to implement Directives, not the Directives themselves. Thus, Directives do not have \"horizontal\" direct effect, meaning they can't be enforced directly between private individuals. This approach has been controversial; in the early 1990s, three Advocate Generals argued Directives should create rights and obligations for everyone. Nevertheless, the Court of Justice disagreed, though five major exceptions do exist.\n\n2.  \nIn EU law, Treaties and Regulations are directly effective when they are precise and unconditional, but Directives usually do not let citizens bring actions against other citizens. This stems from article 288 of the TFEU, which directs Directives at member states and allows them to decide how to achieve objectives. Directives generally set minimum requirements, letting countries go beyond what is required. For instance, the Working Time Directive mandates a minimum of four weeks' paid vacation annually, but many member states offer more. Presently, the Court of Justice holds that individuals can rely on national laws that derive from Directives, but not the Directives themselves, meaning Directives lack horizontal direct effect between private parties. This interpretation has been challenged, especially in the 1990s when some Advocate Generals suggested Directives should apply to everyone. The Court refused, although it recognizes five significant exceptions.\n\n3.  \nAccording to EU law, Treaties and Regulations can apply directly to individuals if they are sufficiently clear and unconditional. However, Directives are not generally intended to give citizens the right to take legal action against each other; such rights are meant for the member states. This principle is supported by article 288 of the TFEU, which specifies that Directives are addressed to member states and leaves it up to them to choose how to enforce them. Directives typically set basic standards that countries can exceed. For example, although all workers in the EU are entitled to at least four weeks of paid leave, many countries provide more. The Court of Justice's current position is that people must rely on their national laws implementing Directives, rather than the Directives, since Directives do not produce horizontal direct effect. This stance has been controversial—some Advocate Generals in the early 1990s strongly advocated for Directives to create rights and obligations for all. While the Court did not agree, it did introduce five significant exceptions.\n\n4.  \nIn the European Union legal system, Treaties and Regulations are directly effective when no further action is needed, but Directives mostly do not let private individuals sue one another. The reasoning lies in TFEU article 288, which says Directives are for member states to implement as they see fit. Such flexibility often means Directives set minimum levels, and national law can be stricter. For instance, having at least 4 weeks' paid holiday is a Directive, though most countries give more. The CJEU currently holds that only national laws implementing Directives may be grounds for legal claims by individuals, not the Directives themselves. As a result, Directives do not have horizontal direct effect, a decision that has sparked debate, especially when three Advocate Generals urged for broader citizen rights from Directives in the 90s. The Court disagreed but allowed five major exceptions to this general rule.",

          "text": "1.  \nGenghis Khan stands out as a major figure in Mongolia's past. He played a key role in shaping the Mongols’ identity, transforming scattered, culturally related tribes into a unified people. By upholding Mongol customs and ensuring peace during times marked by frequent tribal warfare, he fostered both stability and unity. Genghis Khan is also credited with introducing the traditional Mongolian script and establishing the Ikh Zasag, the first codified set of Mongolian laws. According to Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, these laws strongly punished corruption and bribery. President Elbegdorj highlights Genghis Khan’s emphasis on equality under the law for everyone, regardless of class or wealth, as a model for current anti-corruption initiatives. In his speech on Chinggis Khaan's 850th birthday, Elbegdorj praised Genghis Khan as someone who understood that justice depends on equality before the law, not on social differences, and that fair laws outlast grand buildings. For modern Mongolians, Genghis Khan is the central founder of the Mongol Empire and, by extension, the nation of Mongolia.\n\n2.  \nGenghis Khan is one of Mongolia's most notable leaders and is recognized for uniting the previously divided Mongol tribes into a single political and ethnic group. He bolstered traditional Mongol practices and brought peace and cohesion at a time when intertribal violence was commonplace. He is also known for creating the Mongolian writing system and drafting the Ikh Zasag, Mongolia’s first written law code. As noted by President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, this law code treated offenses like corruption and bribery very harshly. President Elbegdorj emphasizes that Genghis Khan’s approach to governance centered on equal legal protection for all, viewing this as inspiration for fighting corruption today. During the 850th anniversary of Genghis Khan’s birth, the president remarked that Genghis valued justice based on legal equality rather than social differences, and recognized the enduring importance of good laws. Ultimately, Genghis Khan is remembered by Mongolians as the key founder of their empire and country.\n\n3.  \nAs one of the most influential figures in Mongolian history, Genghis Khan unified disparate tribes into what became the Mongol nation. He maintained and promoted Mongol traditions, ensuring a rare period of unity and stability during an era of near-constant tribal conflict. Genghis Khan is credited with the introduction of the classical Mongolian script and the development of Mongolia’s first written legal code, Ikh Zasag. President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj points out that Genghis Khan’s laws were particularly strict regarding corruption and bribery. According to Elbegdorj, Genghis Khan established a legacy of equal justice for all, making him a figure to emulate in efforts against corruption. In a commemorative speech, Elbegdorj highlighted Genghis Khan’s understanding that justice thrives on equality before the law and that enduring laws are more important than grand monuments. For Mongolians, Genghis Khan is the foundational figure behind both the Mongol Empire and their national identity.",

Here are some rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline as requested:\n\n1.  \nKublai Khan developed a bureaucratic system for the Yuan dynasty that incorporated aspects of multiple cultures within his empire, such as the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. Although the names of governmental offices suggested an almost entirely Chinese structure, the actual Yuan administration was a blend of different traditions. Much of its Chinese character was drawn from earlier native dynasties like the Tang and Song, as well as the Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Influential Chinese advisors like Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu played key roles in shaping the early Yuan court, leading to the establishment of a central government during Kublai’s first decade in power. This administration made use of the classic Chinese division of authority—separating civil, military, and censorial functions into the Central Secretariat, Privy Council, and Censorate respectively. Despite this, the Yuan government often saw civil and military functions overlap due to Mongol traditions that emphasized military authority. Still, a civilian bureaucracy led by the Central Secretariat—which oversaw most agencies, including the Six Ministries—was set up. Occasionally, a Department of State Affairs focusing on financial matters was created under certain emperors, but it tended to be short-lived.\n\n2.  \nUnder Kublai Khan’s Yuan dynasty, the bureaucratic framework was shaped by multiple cultural influences, including Han Chinese, Khitan, Jurchen, Mongol, and Tibetan Buddhist traditions. While official titles gave the impression of a purely Chinese system, the actual organization was a fusion of various administrative models. Key components, inspired by historical Chinese dynasties and nomadic empires, were integrated, with early advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu guiding these changes. The main governmental structure was established early in Kublai’s rule, modeling the classical Chinese system which separated civil, military, and censory functions through bodies like the Central Secretariat, Privy Council, and Censorate. However, the Mongol preference for military-based administration led to significant overlap between civil and military roles. Despite this, a comprehensive bureaucracy was put in place, with the Central Secretariat at its center overseeing important functions such as those performed by the Six Ministries. On occasion, another high-level agency, the Department of State Affairs, was also formed to handle finances, though these efforts were usually temporary.\n\n3.  \nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan established a bureaucracy that drew from a variety of cultures represented within the empire, including the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. The formal names of government institutions suggested a system modeled after Chinese dynasties, but the Yuan administration was a composite of multiple traditions. Chinese elements in the bureaucracy mainly came from previous dynasties like Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin. Early advisors such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu had significant influence on the court and helped form the initial central government under Kublai. This government followed the traditional Chinese model of separating powers into civil, military, and inspection branches, managed by the Central Secretariat, Privy Council, and Censorate, respectively. Nevertheless, much overlap existed between civil and military matters, reflecting the Mongol emphasis on military governance. In essence, a largely civilian administration was created, with the Central Secretariat as the leading institution responsible for most other agencies, including the Six Ministries. Periodically, the Department of State Affairs emerged as a central finance body, but it rarely lasted long.\n\nLet me know if you want further variations or shorter summaries!",

It works by introducing a pathogen’s antigen to prompt the immune system to develop targeted protection, all without causing the illness itself. This method deliberately uses the immune system’s natural ability to recognize and respond to specific threats. Since infectious diseases are still a major cause of death worldwide, vaccination stands as the most powerful tool humans have created to control the immune system for disease prevention.\n\n2.  \nLong-term active immunity happens when B and T cells are activated after an infection. Vaccines can also produce this active immunity by exposing the body to antigens from pathogens. The idea behind immunization is to encourage the immune system to build defense against a certain microbe without actually causing the disease. This process works well because it takes advantage of how specifically and effectively the immune system works. As infections continue to be a major threat to human health, vaccination is the best method we have for harnessing the immune system’s power.\n\n3.  \nThe immune system develops lasting protection through the activation of B and T cells after encountering an infection. This process, called active immunity, can be artificially induced by vaccines. Vaccination introduces parts of a pathogen to the body, enabling the immune system to prepare defenses without triggering illness. This approach is effective because it relies on the immune system’s precision and ability to mount responses on demand. With infectious diseases being a leading cause of death, vaccines remain the most successful method of utilizing the immune system in medicine.\n\n4.  \nFollowing infection, B and T cells are stimulated, granting the body long-term active immunity. This same result can be achieved intentionally by vaccination, which exposes the immune system to an antigen—part of a pathogen—to train it to fight off future infections without causing harm. This strategy succeeds as it leverages the specific and adaptable nature of our immune responses. In the fight against infectious diseases, which claim many lives globally, vaccines are the most effective way humans have found to strengthen and control immunity.",

On October 12, 1943, the Commission allowed the sale. Soon after, Noble’s new company, the American Broadcasting System, acquired the Blue Network. In 1944, Noble also obtained the rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer, and the parent company was renamed American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. Woods continued to serve as president and CEO of ABC until December 1949, after which he became vice-chairman until leaving the board on June 30, 1951.\n\n2. The network was purchased for $8 million by Edward John Noble, who owned Life Savers, the Rexall chain, and WMCA radio. However, FCC rules required Noble to sell his existing station once the deal, which also involved acquiring three stations from RCA, received regulatory clearance. The transaction was authorized on October 12, 1943. Shortly thereafter, the Blue Network came under the control of Noble's new American Broadcasting System. By 1944, Noble secured the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer, and the parent firm took on the name American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. Woods stayed on as ABC’s president and CEO until December 1949, before being promoted to board vice-chairman, a position he held until June 30, 1951.\n\n3. Edward John Noble, the owner of several businesses including Life Savers candy and Rexall, acquired the network for $8 million, including a deal for three RCA stations. Due to Federal Communications Commission rules, Noble needed to sell his WMCA station once the deal was approved on October 12, 1943. The Blue Network was then purchased by Noble’s new organization, the American Broadcasting System. In 1944, Noble bought the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer, resulting in the company becoming known as American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. Woods retained his roles as president and CEO until the end of 1949, then served as vice-chairman before departing on June 30, 1951.",

They were also innovative, adopting the siege technologies and expertise of the peoples they conquered, especially Muslim and Chinese engineers and their machines, to help their cavalry capture fortified cities. Another core tactic was the feigned retreat, where they would pretend to flee, tricking enemy troops into breaking formation and chasing them, only to ambush and counterattack the now isolated groups.\n\n2. Siege warfare was another area where the Mongol military thrived—they crippled cities by redirecting rivers to cut off supplies, forced captive prisoners to march ahead of their armies, and incorporated new siege tactics and tools from those they defeated, especially using Muslim and Chinese siege engineers to support their cavalry in taking cities. The Mongols frequently relied on the tactic of pretending to retreat, which fooled enemy forces into pursuing them, only for the Mongols to turn and launch a counterattack against the separated and vulnerable enemies.\n\n3. The Mongols were highly effective in siege battles, often depriving their targets of resources by rerouting rivers, pushing prisoners before their advancing troops, and learning the latest siege techniques from conquered people, such as the Muslim and Chinese specialists who constructed siege equipment for them. A hallmark of their military method was the fake withdrawal—by apparently retreating, they tempted segments of the enemy into a chase, making them easy prey for a sudden Mongol ambush.\n\n4. Success in siege warfare was a trademark of the Mongol military. They isolated cities by manipulating water supplies, forced prisoners ahead to break enemy lines, and eagerly adopted advanced siege technologies from cultures like the Chinese and Muslims, using these innovations to help their cavalry storm city defenses. Additionally, the Mongols often used a feigned retreat, tricking enemies into leaving their strongholds and then swiftly attacking them when they were most exposed.\n\n5. The Mongol military was adept at taking cities, employing clever siege tactics such as blocking resources by diverting rivers, sending prisoners before them as a psychological tool, and borrowing new ideas and machines from conquered populations—especially Chinese and Muslim siege experts. One of their best-known maneuvers was the fake retreat: by pretending to flee, they would draw parts of the enemy army out and then turn to ambush them with devastating results.",

Still, if the intention had been to name him after this word, they could have used and written \"Tenggis Khan,\" which was not the case. Alternatively, the Chinese character *Zhèng* (正), meaning \"right,\" \"just,\" or \"true,\" might have been adopted into Mongolian with the adjective suffix \"-s\" to form \"Jenggis,\" which would be rendered \"Genghis\" in old European spellings. Most likely, the 13th-century Mongolian way of saying the name was very similar to \"Chinggis.\"\n\nThere is a theory that Genghis Khan's name originates from the palatalized Mongolian and Turkic word *tenggis*, meaning \"ocean,\" \"oceanic,\" or \"vast.\" The Mongols used this word for Lake Baikal and the sea. However, if this were the true origin, he would have been called \"Tenggis Khan,\" which historical records do not show. Another possibility is the adaptation of the Chinese word *Zhèng* (正), meaning \"right,\" \"just,\" or \"true,\" into Mongolian with the suffix -s forming \"Jenggis,\" which medieval scribes wrote as \"Genghis.\" The original Mongolian pronunciation in the 1200s was probably close to \"Chinggis.\"\n\nSome scholars believe the name Genghis Khan derives from a modified version of the Mongolian and Turkic word *tenggis,* which means \"ocean\" or \"wide-spreading.\" For instance, the term *tenggis* was used by the Mongols for both the ocean and Lake Baikal. Yet, if this were the case, the leader would likely have been called \"Tenggis Khan,\" but this was never recorded. Another theory links the name to the Chinese word *Zhèng* (正), signifying \"right,\" \"just,\" or \"true.\" With the addition of the Mongolian adjectival ending -s, this would yield \"Jenggis,\" written in early romanizations as \"Genghis.\" The way Mongolians pronounced the name in the 13th century was probably very close to \"Chinggis.\"",

Get Carter (1971) stands out for being filmed on location in Newcastle, offering viewers a snapshot of the city in the 1960s and early 1970s. Stormy Monday, a neo-noir thriller from 1988 with Mike Figgis at the helm and a star cast of Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting, and Sean Bean, also used the city's backdrop.\n\n4.  \nOn the Night of the Fire, released in 1939, holds the distinction of being the first film to shoot some exterior scenes in Newcastle upon Tyne, although the film’s action mainly takes place inside a studio. This was followed by The Clouded Yellow (1951) and Payroll (1961), which made greater use of the city’s locations. The iconic Get Carter (1971) was shot entirely on location in and around Newcastle, capturing the city as it appeared in the '60s and early '70s. The city was again featured in Stormy Monday (1988), a film noir thriller directed by Mike Figgis and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting, and Sean Bean.",

          "text": "1.  \nChloroplasts have recently drawn the interest of scientists working on genetically modified crops. In most flowering plants, chloroplasts are maternally inherited, so any transgenes they carry are not spread via pollen. As a result, using plastid transformation provides a way to create genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, greatly minimizing potential environmental risks. This strategy of containment could help standard and organic farming to coexist more effectively. Although this approach hasn’t been thoroughly evaluated across all crop species, encouraging data from tobacco plants show that containment failure for transplastomic lines is only 3 per 1,000,000.\n\n2.  \nDevelopers of genetically engineered crops have recently focused on chloroplasts. Because chloroplasts in most flowering plants are not passed on through the male parent, any genetic modifications in these organelles cannot be transferred by pollen. This characteristic makes altering plastids a powerful approach for creating genetically modified plants that remain environmentally contained. Such biological containment can support the simultaneous existence of traditional and organic farming. Although not all crop types have been assessed, recent research with tobacco suggests a very low failure rate in containment, at just 3 out of every 1,000,000 transgenic plants.\n\n3.  \nChloroplasts have come under the spotlight for use in genetic engineering of crops. One key reason is that, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts aren’t inherited from the male side, which prevents modified genes in chloroplasts from spreading via pollen. This makes chloroplast (plastid) transformation a promising way to create genetically modified plants that are contained and pose fewer environmental threats. Consequently, this method is considered ideal for helping conventional and organic agriculture coexist. Though not fully studied in all crop species, new findings in tobacco plants show the containment system has a failure rate as low as 3 in 1,000,000.\n\n4.  \nRecently, there has been increased interest among developers of genetically modified crops in the use of chloroplasts. Since most flowering plants pass on chloroplasts only from the female parent, any genes added to these organelles will not be spread by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a potent tool for generating genetically modified plants with strong biological containment, thereby reducing environmental concerns. This approach is suitable for maintaining both conventional and organic farming practices alongside each other. While studies have not yet covered all crops, promising results in tobacco indicate that the containment mechanism fails in only 3 cases per million transplastomic plants.",

      "context": "In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.",

          "text": "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the provided passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nIn English scholarship, the study of imperialism often draws from British historical examples. The word \"Imperialism\" was adopted into modern English during the late 1870s by critics accusing British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli of forceful and flashy imperial policies. Soon, advocates like Joseph Chamberlain began using the term in support of such expansion. Interpretations have varied, with some viewing imperialism as an altruistic or idealistic endeavor, while others see it driven by national self-interest or capitalist ambition. Liberal thinker John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin gave the concept a broader economic meaning, particularly Lenin, who argued that imperialism was an inevitable outcome of capitalism’s need for continual growth, resources, and investment, resulting in colonial expansion. Later Marxist writers continued to stress this structural view, and the concept of imperialism came to refer to a longstanding global system rather than a specific policy or period. This expanded usage often traces imperialism back to Columbus’s voyages or even the Crusades. As its meaning has broadened, imperialism is now discussed through moral, economic, systemic, cultural, and temporal perspectives—mirroring growing discomfort with the reality of Western dominance.\n\n2.  \nTheories of imperialism in anglophone academia commonly focus on Britain’s imperial history. The term \"Imperialism\" found its current English meaning in the late 19th century, first appearing among detractors of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli’s expansionist foreign policies. Champions like Joseph Chamberlain swiftly reappropriated it. To some, imperialism was an idealistic and philanthropic venture, but critics increasingly linked it to self-serving politics and capitalist exploitation. Thinkers such as Hobson and Lenin gave the term a more macroeconomic and theoretical dimension. Lenin, in his influential book, argued that imperialism is the natural extension of capitalism’s relentless expansionist needs, necessitating colonialism. This systemic interpretation has been echoed by subsequent Marxists, who further broadened the concept. Today, imperialism is often seen as a centuries-spanning global system, not just a late-19th-century British policy, with its meaning stretching across moral, economic, structural, cultural, and historical lines—reflecting the growing discomfort with Western power structures.\n\n3.  \nImperialism, as studied in English-speaking academic circles, frequently draws on Britain’s colonial legacy. The concept entered the English language in its current sense in the late 1870s, largely as a criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli’s aggressive imperial actions. It was soon adopted by advocates of imperialism as well, such as Joseph Chamberlain. Initially, imperialism was painted either as a lofty, philanthropic idea or condemned for its selfish motives and capitalist greed. Theorists like Hobson and Lenin introduced key economic critiques, with Lenin famously framing imperialism as a consequence of capitalism’s perpetual need for new resources and markets, a stance that influenced generations of Marxists. Over time, the concept grew to encompass not a mere historical moment, but a centuries-long global system—some even trace its origins to the age of Columbus or the Crusades. Present-day discussions reflect shifts in understanding imperialism in moral, economic, systemic, cultural, and temporal terms, signifying discomfort with the ongoing reality of Western global power.\n\n4.  \nIn anglophone academic writing, imperialism is typically examined through the lens of Britain’s history. The term \"Imperialism\" was first used in its modern sense in the late 1870s by those opposing Benjamin Disraeli’s assertive imperial strategies. Supporters such as Joseph Chamberlain quickly began to claim the label as well. Early interpretations ranged from seeing imperialism as a benevolent mission to an exercise in self-interest or a symptom of capitalist exploitation. Major theorists like Hobson and Lenin imbued the concept with economic depth, with Lenin arguing that imperialism was a structural necessity of capitalism’s expansionist logic, and this analysis was picked up by many later left-wing scholars. As the term’s use widened, it came to represent not just a particular ideology or historical period, but a vast world system originating as far back as European colonial efforts or the Crusades. The meaning of imperialism now spans moral, economic, structural, cultural, and temporal dimensions, reflecting an increasing discomfort with the idea and consequences of Western dominance.",

The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.

          "text": "1.  \nThe origin of the term “Huguenot” is uncertain and was originally used as a mocking label. Researchers have offered different theories, one of which connects the word to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (d. 1532) and the complex religious politics of Swiss republicanism. The term may be a play on Hugues’ name, combined with the Dutch \"Huisgenoten\" (meaning “housemates”), and the German \"Eidgenosse\" (a term for members of the Swiss Confederacy). Geneva, known as John Calvin’s center of activity, was Hugues’ city, where he led a party favoring alliance with the Swiss Confederation for independence from the Duke of Savoy. In France, the label Huguenot was said to have first been applied to members of the Reformed Church involved in the failed Amboise conspiracy of 1560 against the House of Guise. The name thus came to associate French Protestants with unpopular foreign politics.\n\n2.  \n“Huguenot” was initially a term of ridicule whose exact origin remains a mystery, though several explanations have been given. One theory ties the term to Besançon Hugues, a Catholic leader in Geneva, and references to Dutch and German words meaning “housemates” and “confederates.” Hugues led the “Confederate Party,” pushing for Geneva’s independence via alliance with the Swiss Confederation, during the time that Geneva served as the hub of Calvinism. The name “Huguenot” supposedly first appeared in France to describe noble Protestant conspirators involved in the Amboise plot of 1560, who sought to shift power away from the House of Guise and perhaps further relations with Switzerland. The name thereby evolved as a combination of political and religious connotations unfamiliar or unwelcome in France.\n\n3.  \nOriginally meant to mock, the word \"Huguenot\" has a debated history. Some believe it originated as a pun mixing the name of Besançon Hugues, a Geneva politician, with the Dutch word \"Huisgenoten\" (\"housemates\") and the German \"Eidgenosse\" (\"confederate”). During Hugues’ time, Geneva—Calvin’s chosen city—was a focal point for religious and political struggles, including Hugues’ own push for independence from Savoy through a Swiss alliance. In France, “Huguenot” reportedly initially referred to Protestant nobles involved in the 1560 Amboise plot against the ruling House of Guise, marking them with a name linked to both foreign politics and the Protestant Reformation.",

He kept improving the translation right up until he died. Although others had previously translated the Bible into German, Luther shaped his version according to his doctrinal beliefs. When people criticized him for adding the word \"alone\" to Romans 3:28 after \"faith,\" Luther defended his choice by arguing that the context and Paul’s meaning demanded it, since Paul was emphasizing that salvation comes through faith in Christ, not through works. Luther insisted that to clearly express the exclusion of works, one must say, \"Faith alone justifies us, and not works.\"\n\n2.  \nIn 1522, Martin Luther published the New Testament in German, and, along with his colleagues, completed the Old Testament translation in 1534—the year the whole Bible appeared in German. Luther continuously revised his translation until his death. Unlike earlier versions, Luther's translation reflected his own doctrinal views. He was criticized for adding \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, but responded that the passage required it, as it dealt directly with the principle of justification by faith in Christ alone, apart from works. Accordingly, Luther believed the only way to be clear was to state, “We are justified by faith alone, not by works.”\n\n3.  \nMartin Luther's translation of the New Testament into German was published in 1522, and he, with help from others, completed the Old Testament by 1534, resulting in the publication of the full Bible. He worked on refining the text for the rest of his life. Unlike previous German translations, Luther adapted his version to fit his theological views. When accused of inserting \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, Luther contended that St. Paul's teaching on justification by faith necessitated the addition. He argued that, since the passage intends to exclude the role of works, truthfully expressing it means saying, “Faith alone justifies, not works.”",

By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime. Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime. By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a \"unit\".\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

It was Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt, in 1805, who showed water is actually made from two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen.

In 1805, experimental findings by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt revealed that water is made from two units of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Then, in 1811, Amedeo Avogadro arrived at the correct formula for water, using his own law and understanding that elements like hydrogen and oxygen form molecules made of two atoms.",

Unlike Céloron, who four years earlier marked French claims only by burying lead plates, Marin built actual forts and stationed troops. His first fortification, Fort Presque Isle, was raised near modern-day Erie, Pennsylvania, followed by the construction of a road to LeBoeuf Creek's headwaters where he built Fort Le Boeuf near present-day Waterford. As Marin’s forces advanced south, they pushed out or captured British traders, causing alarm among the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson, a Mingo chief who distrusted the French due to personal grievances, confronted the French at Fort Le Boeuf and threatened retaliation, but Marin ignored these threats.\n\n**Version 2:**\nIn early 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was ordered to lead a 2,000-strong group of Troupes de la Marine and Native allies to defend France’s claims in the Ohio Valley from British intrusion. Marin took the path that Céloron had once explored, but went further by constructing forts wherever Céloron had only left lead markers. The first, Fort Presque Isle, was built on Lake Erie’s southern shore near today’s Erie, Pennsylvania. A road connected this to the newly established Fort Le Boeuf at the source of LeBoeuf Creek in what is now Waterford. Marin’s campaign forced British traders out, which worried both British interests and the Iroquois. Meanwhile, Tanaghrisson—a Mingo chief hostile to the French—arrived at Fort Le Boeuf, issuing warnings of war that Marin dismissed outright.\n\n**Version 3:**\nSpring 1753 saw Paul Marin de la Malgue take charge of a French and Indian force of 2,000, tasked with defending the Ohio Valley from British advances. Following the route charted by Céloron years earlier but taking further action, Marin oversaw the building and manning of forts, starting with Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie’s southern edge near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. He then ordered a road built to the source of LeBoeuf Creek and erected Fort Le Boeuf near what is now Waterford. As Marin’s men advanced southward, they expelled British traders, sparking concern among both the British and the local Iroquois. One leader, Tanaghrisson—a Mingo chief with deep resentment towards the French—approached the new forts and threatened an attack, which Marin scoffed at.\n\n**Version 4:**\nIn the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue led two thousand French and Native troops to safeguard the French King’s interests in the Ohio Valley from British takeover. Marin took a more aggressive approach than earlier French efforts, building and garrisoning Fort Presque Isle near modern Erie, Pennsylvania, and Fort Le Boeuf at the origins of LeBoeuf Creek near Waterford. He set up a connecting road and actively removed British traders from the region, which alarmed the British and their Iroquois allies. Tanaghrisson, leader of the Mingo and fierce opponent of the French due to past grievances, traveled to Fort Le Boeuf to protest, but Marin disregarded his warning of possible conflict.",

This trend might be changing, as more consultant pharmacists work directly with patients, especially since many seniors taking multiple drugs remain outside of care facilities. Some community pharmacies also offer consultant pharmacist services or hire consultants.\n\n2.  \nThe main role of consultant pharmacy is to conduct medication regimen reviews—focusing on providing expert medication advice rather than dispensing medications. These pharmacists have traditionally operated in nursing homes, but their roles are expanding into various institutional and even home environments. Although consultant pharmacists were often independent entrepreneurs, many in the U.S. now work for major pharmacy management companies like Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare, and PharMerica. However, as more seniors who need complex medication management live independently, consultant pharmacists are increasingly working directly with patients. In addition, some community pharmacies also employ consultant pharmacists or offer consulting services.\n\n3.  \nIn consultant pharmacy, the emphasis is on evaluating patients’ medication plans rather than physically dispensing drugs. Most commonly found in nursing homes, consultant pharmacists are starting to work in a broader range of institutional and non-institutional locations. Once primarily independent professionals, many now work for large American pharmacy companies such as Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare, and PharMerica. Lately, there is a shift back toward direct patient care as more elderly individuals living at home require medication management. Some community pharmacies utilize consultant pharmacists or offer medication consulting as a service.\n\n4.  \nRather than focusing on dispensing medications, consultant pharmacists specialize in conducting medication regimen reviews, also known as providing cognitive services. They have usually worked in nursing homes but are increasingly present in other healthcare settings and even in people’s homes. Historically, consultant pharmacists owned their own businesses, but many now work for major U.S. pharmacy management organizations like Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare, and PharMerica. This may be changing as more consultants work directly with patients because of the rise in elderly, non-institutionalized patients who take multiple medications. Community pharmacies may also employ consultant pharmacists or offer such consulting services.",

In South Africa, a number of private schools trace their origins back to missionary-founded church schools from the early nineteenth century. The number of such private schools has increased over the years. With the conclusion of apartheid, the regulations surrounding private education underwent major changes. The South African Schools Act of 1996 created two principal categories: \"public\" schools, which are overseen by the government, and \"independent\" schools, referring to both conventional private schools and those with private management structures.\n\n4. Some of South Africa’s oldest schools began as church-run private institutions set up by missionaries during the early 1800s, initiating a long history of private education. This sector has expanded consistently. Following the dismantling of apartheid, laws affecting private schools were significantly revised.

For example, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be recognized in linear time with a multi-tape Turing machine, but it takes quadratic time on a single-tape Turing machine. If we consider running times that may differ by a polynomial factor, the Cobham-Edmonds thesis suggests that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This provides the foundation for the complexity class P—the class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. The equivalent class for function problems is known as FP.\n\n2.  \nSpecifying an upper bound on computation time as a particular function f(n) often creates complexity classes that depend on the computational model selected. For instance, the problem of determining if a string belongs to the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be done in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but requires quadratic time on a single-tape Turing machine. When polynomial differences in running time are allowed, the Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that for all reasonable and general models of computation, their time complexities are related by a polynomial (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This underlies the definition of the complexity class P, which includes all decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. For function problems, the analogous class is called FP.\n\n3.  \nPlacing an upper bound on computation time using a specific function f(n) can lead to complexity classes that are dependent on the chosen computational framework. For example, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be decided in linear time by a multi-tape Turing machine, but a single-tape Turing machine would need quadratic time for the same task. The Cobham-Edmonds thesis posits that when we allow polynomial differences in running time, “the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related” (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2).

He first presented this concept in briefing B-265 in the summer of 1961, followed by its publication as RAND report P-2626 in 1962 and later as report RM 3420 in 1964. Report P-2626 detailed an overall framework for a large, distributed, and resilient communications network. The research emphasized three main points: a decentralized network structure with multiple routes between any two nodes, breaking user messages into blocks (later called packets), and transmitting these messages using store-and-forward switching.\n\n2.  \nDuring his work at the RAND Corporation, Baran invented the principle of distributed adaptive message block switching for the US Air Force, aiming to create communication networks that could withstand attacks. He introduced these ideas to the Air Force in 1961, published them as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and expanded on them in RM 3420 in 1964. The 1962 report outlined a broad system for a scalable, survivable, and distributed communications network. The approach was based on three essential concepts: using a decentralized network with alternate paths between points, dividing communications into smaller message blocks (later known as packets), and forwarding these blocks through store-and-forward switching.\n\n3.  \nWhile conducting research at the RAND Corporation, Baran conceptualized distributed adaptive message block switching for the US Air Force to ensure communication networks could survive attacks. He presented this work in briefing B-265 in 1961, published it as report P-2626 in 1962, and later as RM 3420 in 1964. Report P-2626 described a general plan for a robust and distributed communication network. The cornerstone ideas were: a network composed of decentralized nodes with multiple pathways, splitting user data into smaller blocks (packets), and utilizing store-and-forward techniques to send these messages.\n\n4.  \nBaran’s research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force led to the development of distributed adaptive message block switching, first presented in 1961, then detailed in the 1962 RAND report P-2626, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964. Report P-2626 described architecture for a distributed and durable communication network. The main principles included using a decentralized network with several routes linking any two points, breaking messages into smaller packet-like blocks, and sending them using store-and-forward switching methods.",

In the chloroplast, photosystem II splits water molecules to obtain and energize new electrons, while photosystem I reenergizes electrons that have already traveled through an electron transport chain. Typically, these high-energy electrons are accepted by NADP+, but sometimes they return to the electron transport chain, pumping additional hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space and producing more ATP. This process, known as cyclic photophosphorylation, involves the recycling of electrons. Cyclic photophosphorylation is especially prevalent in C4 plants, which have a greater demand for ATP compared to NADPH.\n\n2. Inside the chloroplast, photosystem II is responsible for breaking apart water to harvest fresh electrons and energize them. In contrast, photosystem I recharges electrons that have already lost energy after moving through the electron transport chain. Usually, these reenergized electrons are picked up by NADP+, but they can also be recycled back through the chain, further moving hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space and making extra ATP—this recycling is called cyclic photophosphorylation. C4 plants often use this process because they require more ATP than NADPH.\n\n3. In chloroplasts, photosystem II photolyzes water to get new electrons and energize them, while photosystem I's role is to boost the energy of electrons that have made their way down the electron transport chain. The revived electrons are usually handed off to NADP+, but occasionally, they loop back into electron transport chains, moving more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, leading to increased ATP synthesis. This electron cycling is called cyclic photophosphorylation and is commonly observed in C4 plants, which need higher amounts of ATP relative to NADPH.\n\n4. The chloroplast functions so that photosystem II obtains electrons from water by photolysis and energizes them, whereas photosystem I recharges electrons that have passed through the electron transport chain. Normally, NADP+ collects these boosted electrons; however, they sometimes travel back along additional H+-pumping chains, pushing more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space and resulting in more ATP production. This recycling process, known as cyclic photophosphorylation, happens more often in C4 plants due to their greater ATP needs compared to NADPH.",

In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Together with Coke, Wesley sent a revision of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Occasionally, a tiny fragment would break off from the cathode, exit the tube, and hit him. Tesla explained that he could feel a sudden, sharp pain when the particle entered his body and again as it exited. Comparing these particles to those fired by his \"electric gun,\" he claimed that the particles in his beam of force would move at much greater speeds and travel in focused groups.\n\n2.  \nOn July 11, 1934, the New York Herald Tribune featured an article about Tesla, where he recounted an incident from his experiments with vacuum tubes using a single electrode. From time to time, a small piece of the cathode would detach, escape the tube, and make contact with him. Tesla said he noticed a sharp, stinging sensation where the particle entered his body and felt it again as it exited. Relating these to the metal bits shot by his \"electric gun,\" Tesla asserted that the particles in his \"beam of force\" would move even faster and would be concentrated as they traveled.\n\n3.  \nAccording to a July 11, 1934 New York Herald Tribune article, Nikola Tesla shared an event from his experiments with single-electrode vacuum tubes. Every so often, a minuscule particle would break away from the cathode, leave the tube, and physically strike him. Tesla reported feeling a distinct pain where the particle went in and again where it exited. He compared them to fragments from his \"electric gun,\" but insisted that particles in his \"beam of force\" would move far more rapidly and travel in concentrated streams.\n\n4.  \nThe New York Herald Tribune ran a story on July 11, 1934, in which Tesla described experiences from his work with single-electrode vacuum tubes. Sometimes, a tiny bit would come off the cathode, exit the tube, and hit him, causing a sharp pain both entering and leaving his body. Tesla related these to particles from his \"electric gun,\" noting that those projected by his beam of force would be much faster and travel in concentrated beams.\n\n5.  \nIn a 1934 article, Tesla described to the New York Herald Tribune how, during his vacuum tube experiments, a minute particle occasionally detached from the cathode and struck him as it left the apparatus.

Tesla said that, unlike the metal bits fired by his \"electric gun,\" his \"beam of force\" would propel particles much faster and in dense groupings.",

This connection between higher income and longer life persists in poorer countries today, where rising income leads to substantial gains in life expectancy. However, in recent years, this trend has slowed in middle-income nations and leveled off in the wealthiest thirty or so countries. For example, despite having a higher GDP per capita, Americans, with an average life expectancy of around 77 years in 2004, live no longer than Greeks or New Zealanders, who each average 78 years. In contrast, countries like Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82 years), where wealth is distributed more evenly, have higher life expectancies.\n\n2.  \nHistorically, having better material conditions—fulfilling basic needs like food, clean water, and warmth—meant people lived healthier and longer lives. This link between wealth and longevity remains true in the world's poorer nations, where increases in average income bring rapid rises in life expectancy. But this relationship has weakened for middle-income countries and stalled for the top richest thirty countries. For instance, the average American life expectancy in 2004 was about 77 years, which is not higher than Greece’s or New Zealand’s 78 years, despite Americans having more wealth. Swedes and Japanese, who live in societies with more equal income distribution, enjoy even higher life expectancies of 80 and 82 years, respectively.\n\n3.  \nIn most of human history, greater wealth—meaning adequate food, clean water, and heating—led to people living longer and being healthier. This trend of higher income equating to longer life still applies to low-income countries today. Yet, among countries with middle incomes and the richest thirty nations, this connection has weakened or plateaued. For example, the average life expectancy in the USA in 2004 was 77 years, similar to Greece and New Zealand (both 78 years), though Americans have a higher per capita GDP. People in Sweden and Japan, where income is shared more equally, tend to live longer (80 years and 82 years, respectively).\n\n4.  \nOver much of human existence, higher standards of living—like enough to eat, clean water, and heating—have directly contributed to longer, healthier lives. While this relationship between increased income and lifespan remains strong for poorer nations, it has slowed for those with middle incomes and stopped rising for the world’s thirty wealthiest countries. As an illustration, Americans had an average lifespan of about 77 years in 2004, which is no longer than Greeks or New Zealanders, both at 78 years, even though the US has a higher GDP per person. Meanwhile, Sweden and Japan—with more equal income distribution—show even greater life expectancies at 80 and 82 years.",

He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason.

Looking for more certainty in life, Luther turned to theology and philosophy, delving into the works of Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was especially shaped by his teachers, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to question even the most renowned thinkers and evaluate ideas through his own experience. Yet, philosophy left him unsatisfied—it could validate reason, but not show how to love God, which was what Luther truly sought. He believed that reason alone couldn't lead people to God, and so he developed mixed feelings about Aristotle because of his focus on reason. Luther came to believe that while reason was valuable for questioning people and institutions, it could not be applied to God. Instead, he thought that true knowledge of God could only come from divine revelation, and as a result, he placed increasing importance on the Bible.\n\n2.  \nLuther, obeying his father's direction, enrolled in law school at the university, but soon abandoned it, thinking the study of law lacked certainty. Craving assurance in life, Luther gravitated towards theology and philosophy, and became interested in the ideas of Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. His instructors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, influenced him by encouraging skepticism towards even the most established thinkers, urging him to rely on personal experience as a guide. Still, philosophy left Luther unfulfilled—it affirmed the power of reason but didn't help him understand love for God, his deepest concern. He felt that reason couldn't bring someone closer to God and thus formed a conflicted attitude toward Aristotle, critical of his stress on rationality. Luther concluded that reason should challenge human claims, but not divine ones. For him, knowledge of God was only attainable through God’s revelation, making Scripture increasingly central in his life.\n\n3.  \nAt his father's insistence, Luther enrolled in law school that year, at the same university, but quickly dropped out, feeling that law lacked the certainty he desired. Instead, he was drawn to theology and philosophy, particularly the works of Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. Luther was greatly influenced by two of his teachers, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to question even the greatest minds and rely on his own experiences. However, philosophy left him dissatisfied; it offered confidence in reason but not in the love of God, which was most important to Luther. He felt reason could not bring humans to God, leading to a mixed regard for Aristotle, whose focus on reason he found troubling. Reason, Luther believed, was valuable for scrutinizing people and institutions, but not for understanding God. He came to see that humans could only know God through revelation, and so Scripture gained increasing importance for him.",

Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Around the time of the first Moon landing in 1969, NASA decided to use an already-built Saturn V rocket to launch the Skylab space station, rather than assembling it in orbit from parts launched by several Saturn IB rockets. This change led to the cancellation of Apollo 20. As NASA’s budget decreased following the Moon landing, funds were also redirected to support the Space Shuttle’s development. In 1971, NASA chose to cancel Apollo missions 18 and 19 as well. The Saturn V rockets that were not used ended up on display at museums, including the Kennedy Space Center, the Marshall Space Center, the Michoud Assembly Facility, and the Johnson Space Center.\n\n2. With the success of Apollo 11 in 1969, NASA opted to launch Skylab using a spare Saturn V, doing away with the previous idea of building the station in orbit via multiple Saturn IB launches. This shift resulted in the cancellation of Apollo 20. The agency’s budget was also being reduced and had to accommodate the new Space Shuttle project. By 1971, Apollo missions 18 and 19 were also cancelled. The remaining Saturn V rockets that were never launched are now exhibited at facilities such as Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Center, Michoud Assembly Facility, and Johnson Space Center.\n\n3. Following the first lunar landing in 1969, NASA decided to repurpose a Saturn V rocket to send the pre-constructed Skylab into orbit, instead of assembling it in space from parts delivered by several Saturn IBs, thus canceling Apollo 20. At the same time, NASA’s funding was cut, and resources shifted to the Space Shuttle. By 1971, the agency cancelled Apollo 18 and 19 as well. The leftover Saturn V rockets now serve as museum artifacts at locations like the Kennedy and Marshall Space Centers, the Michoud Assembly Facility, and the Johnson Space Center.\n\n4. After putting astronauts on the Moon in 1969, NASA chose to use a Saturn V to launch Skylab in one go, replacing their original plan to assemble it in orbit with several launches using Saturn IB rockets. This decision led them to scrap Apollo 20. Continued budget cuts and the need to finance the Space Shuttle forced NASA to also cancel Apollo missions 18 and 19 by 1971. The two Saturn Vs that weren’t flown ended up as museum pieces at various NASA locations, including Kennedy Space Center and others.",

During these active periods, anti-inflammatory substances such as cortisol and catecholamines also peak. There are two main theories explaining why the body reserves a pro-inflammatory state for sleep. The first suggests that inflammation during waking hours would significantly hinder cognitive and physical abilities. The second theory proposes that the presence of melatonin at night enables the body to manage the oxidative stress caused by inflammation, as melatonin can neutralize free radicals during sleep.\n\n2.  \nWhen we’re awake, the immune system ramps up the activity of its effector cells, including cytotoxic natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to defend against pathogens. At the same time, anti-inflammatory agents like cortisol and catecholamines are at their highest. Why is inflammation mainly a nighttime event? One explanation is that inflammation would impair our thinking and performance if it happened during the day. Another is that melatonin, which is released during sleep, helps the body limit the damage from inflammation-induced oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals at night.\n\n3.  \nDuring periods of wakefulness, our differentiated immune cells—such as cytotoxic NK cells and CTLs—are most active, ensuring a robust immune response to pathogens. Awake periods are also marked by peak levels of anti-inflammatory hormones like cortisol and catecholamines. Scientists have proposed two reasons why inflammation predominantly occurs at night. One theory holds that if inflammation arose during the day, it would cause significant cognitive and physical issues. The other theory notes that melatonin, present during sleep, might protect the body from the oxidative stress generated by inflammation, thanks to its ability to fight free radicals.\n\n4.  \nThe immune system behaves differently throughout the day. When a person is awake, cells like cytotoxic NK cells and CTLs increase in number to defend against infection, and anti-inflammatory compounds such as cortisol and catecholamines are at their highest. There are two main hypotheses for why a pro-inflammatory state is generally limited to sleep. Inflammation could harm mental and physical function if present during wakefulness. Alternatively, since melatonin is present during sleep and helps fight oxidative stress, it may allow the body to tolerate inflammation at night.",

The Alta Vista Tract began its transformation from alfalfa fields in 1910, when William Stranahan mapped out 190 acres for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, with an official plat completed in 1911. The tract was bordered by Balch Avenue to the south, Cedar Avenue to the east, Platt Avenue to the north, and First Street to the west. In January 1912, the subdivision joined the City following the first election in which women participated locally. Though initially unpopulated, the tract was beautifully landscaped, with trees watered by tank cart. When Billings & Meyering purchased the area in 1914, they finished the streets, brought in water service, and began aggressively marketing the lots. Within five years, 267 homes stood there, a boom spurred by streetcar service provided by the Fresno Traction Company along Huntington Boulevard, connecting residents to downtown and the County Hospital.\n\n---\n\nLining a central stretch of Huntington Boulevard in Fresno’s historic Alta Vista Tract are large, elegant houses built in the early twentieth century.

In January 1912, following a landmark election that allowed women voters, the area was annexed to the city. At annexation, the tract had no residents but was landscaped, with water for the trees delivered by tank wagon. In 1914, developers Billings & Meyering bought the tract, finalized its infrastructure, and energetically marketed the lots. By 1919, 267 houses were built—growth fueled by a streetcar line on Huntington Boulevard, which made commuting to downtown Fresno and the County Hospital easy.\n\n---\n\nEarly 20th-century homes grace Huntington Boulevard between First Street and Cedar Avenue in central Fresno’s historic Alta Vista Tract. Once an alfalfa field, the 190-acre subdivision was mapped for the Pacific Improvement Corporation in 1911 by William Stranahan. Its boundaries stretched from Balch Avenue in the south to Platt Avenue in the north, and from First to Cedar on the east and west. The tract joined the City of Fresno in January 1912 after the first election allowing women to vote in the community. Initially, the land was empty but fully landscaped, with water for new trees delivered by wagon. Developers Billings & Meyering acquired the land in 1914, finished its infrastructure, and began an energetic marketing campaign. Within five years, 267 homes had been built, thanks in large part to the streetcar that ran along Huntington Boulevard.

The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of \"trading-class stock and middling means\" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498.

Here are a few rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\nMartin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Saxony, to Hans Luder and Margarethe Lindemann. The next day, which was the feast of St. Martin of Tours, he was baptized as a Catholic. In 1484, his family relocated to Mansfeld, where his father worked in copper mining and was active in local governance. According to religious scholar Martin Marty, Luther’s mother was a diligent woman from a family of modest means, and negative rumors about her were spread by Luther’s opponents. Luther had several siblings and shared a particularly close relationship with his brother Jacob. Hans Luther hoped that Martin would become a lawyer and sent him to study at Latin schools in Mansfeld, Magdeburg, and later Eisenach, where his studies included grammar, rhetoric, and logic—a curriculum Luther later likened to suffering in purgatory and hell.\n\nBorn on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben within the Holy Roman Empire, Martin Luther was the first son of Hans and Margarethe Luther. He was christened the day after his birth on St. Martin of Tours’ feast day. The family moved to the mining town of Mansfeld a year later, where his father held a lease on mines and was prominent in the community. Scholar Martin Marty describes Luther’s mother as a hardworking woman of middle-class origins and debunks insults made about her by Luther’s detractors. Luther had a number of siblings, being especially close to Jacob. Hans Luther had high hopes for his son’s future, wanting him to become a lawyer, so he enrolled Martin in schools focused on grammar, rhetoric, and logic—subjects Martin later remembered as torturous.\n\nMartin Luther entered the world in Eisleben, Saxony, on November 10, 1483, to Hans and Margarethe Luther. He was baptized Catholic the following morning, coinciding with St. Martin of Tours’ feast. A year into his life, the family shifted to Mansfeld, where Hans oversaw copper mining operations and participated in civic life. Martin Marty, a scholar, portrays Luther’s mother as industrious and coming from a family of average wealth, though malicious rumors later misrepresented her character. Among several siblings, Martin was particularly close to Jacob. Wanting Martin to become a lawyer, Hans enrolled him in various Latin schools in Mansfeld, Magdeburg, and Eisenach, where teaching centered around grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Luther would later reflect on these years as extremely harsh.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further variations or a summary version!",

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours.

He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498. The three schools focused on the so-called \"trivium\": grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Between 1947 and 1967, oil prices in dollars increased by less than two percent each year. Prices stayed relatively steady compared to other currencies and goods until the oil shock occurred. OPEC ministers lacked systems to keep oil prices aligned with changing market conditions, resulting in reduced real incomes. The major price hikes in 1973–1974 mostly restored prices and OPEC incomes to the levels of the Bretton Woods era, especially when measured against commodities like gold.\n\n2.  \nThe oil shock of 1973 was influenced by slow price adjustments by OPEC following 1971. For two decades prior, from 1947 to 1967, oil prices in dollars rose very gradually, less than two percent annually, and remained steady compared to other currencies and commodities. Because OPEC didn't have efficient methods for updating prices with shifting markets, their real earnings suffered. The significant hikes in oil prices during 1973–1974 mainly brought their revenues and oil values back up to the levels equivalent to the Bretton Woods period when compared with commodities like gold.\n\n3.  \nThe so-called \"Oil Shock\" of 1973 was partly due to OPEC's delayed response in raising oil prices after 1971, despite the depreciating dollar. Historically, from 1947 to 1967, oil prices saw annual increases of less than two percent and were stable relative to other currencies and commodities. OPEC lacked effective processes to frequently revise oil prices alongside market fluctuations, causing their real incomes to fall behind. The sharp rises in oil prices between 1973 and 1974 essentially reset their prices and earnings to the standards set during the Bretton Woods era, particularly in relation to commodities such as gold.\n\n4.  \nDuring the 1973 oil crisis, known as the \"Oil Shock,\" OPEC reacted slowly to the falling value of the dollar after 1971 and did not promptly raise oil prices. From 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil increased by less than two percent yearly and stayed fairly constant when compared with other currencies and commodities. Because OPEC ministers hadn't established systematic ways to adjust prices with changing market demands, their real income decreased over time.

The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme \"Behind the Sofa\". The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill \"at the center of many people's relationship with the show\", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the \"scariest TV show of all time\".\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

          "text": "1. During the Middle Ages, medical understanding made little progress. The leading explanation for the Black Death came from Parisian medical scholars, who told the French king that a planetary alignment in 1345 had produced a harmful miasma. Their report was the first of many widely shared treatises offering advice to those affected. The idea that the disease was spread by corrupted air, now called the Miasma theory, became the dominant view. At the time, the term 'plague' was not specifically associated with this illness; its repeated outbreaks in the Middle Ages later gave it that name in医学.\n\n2. In the Middle Ages, medical knowledge remained static. The most respected source was a document from the University of Paris, which claimed a planetary conjunction in 1345 polluted the air and sparked the epidemic. This account was widely distributed, becoming the first of numerous guides to help the afflicted. The belief that bad, pestilential air caused the plague—what we now refer to as the Miasma theory—prevailed. The designation 'plague' only became linked to the disease after multiple medieval outbreaks gave it lasting notoriety.\n\n3. The understanding of disease hardly advanced in medieval times. Paris’s medical experts told the king that the alignment of three planets in 1345 generated a poisonous atmosphere responsible for the plague. Their report was the initial and most influential of several pamphlets advising victims. The theory that the plague resulted from tainted air, now called the Miasma theory, gained the most acceptance. Initially, 'plague' was just a generic term, only becoming a specific medical label after recurring epidemics.\n\n4. Medical progress was slow throughout the Middle Ages. The principal explanation for the Black Death came from doctors in Paris, asserting that a conjunction of planets in 1345 led to a deadly pestilence in the air. Their document became the first widely spread account of the plague, followed by similar advisories. The popular theory blamed foul air—known to us as the Miasma theory. The term 'plague' didn’t uniquely identify this illness at the start, but frequent medieval outbreaks led to its modern meaning.",

          "text": "**Rewritten passages:**\n\n1.  \nAccording to Article 294 of the TFEU, most EU laws are made through an \"ordinary legislative procedure\" involving up to three readings. It starts with a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament can block or amend this proposal if a majority of all MEPs agree, rather than just those present. The Council can approve changes by a qualified majority, but it must be unanimous to block Commission amendments. If the institutions disagree, a Conciliation Committee made up of MEPs, ministers, and Commission members attempts to reach a compromise text, which is then sent for approval to Parliament and Council. This structure makes it easier to maintain existing EU law than to change it, as legislation can be stopped by different majorities or minorities in various institutions. Budgetary matters use a different process. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among some member states, Council approval is needed. The Commission is supposed to inform national governments before starting new proposals. The EU can only legislate within the powers given in the Treaties. As per TEU articles 4 and 5, member states retain powers unless specifically transferred, though it’s debated who gets to decide what the EU’s powers are—many national courts or parliaments claim this right, but within the EU, the Court of Justice asserts final authority.\n\n2.  \nThe process for passing most EU laws is set by Article 294 of the TFEU and is called the \"ordinary legislative procedure.\" It involves up to three rounds of review and begins with a proposal from the European Commission. The Parliament must muster a majority of all its members to reject or amend the proposal, not just a majority of those present. On the Council side, a qualified majority can approve changes, but a unanimous vote is needed to block a Commission proposal. If disagreements persist, a Conciliation Committee is formed with members from the Parliament, Council, and Commission to find common ground. Any compromise is sent back for final approval by an absolute majority in Parliament and a qualified majority in Council. This system allows laws to be blocked by different combinations within the institutions, making change more difficult than maintaining the status quo. Budget rules follow another procedure. For a group of member states to proceed with \"enhanced cooperation,\" the Council’s permission is required. The Commission has to notify national governments before starting new legislation. The EU is only allowed to act within powers granted by the Treaties—under TEU articles 4 and 5, leftover powers stay with the member states, though debate continues over which authority has the right to define EU powers. National courts or parliaments often claim this role, while the EU Court of Justice insists it decides in the end.\n\n3.  \nEU lawmaking mainly follows the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" outlined in TFEU Article 294. This process starts with a Commission proposal and can take up to three readings. The European Parliament may block or amend measures with a majority of the entire membership, not just those attending. The Council must muster a qualified majority to accept changes, but full unanimity is necessary to block Commission amendments. Stalemates between the institutions are tackled by a Conciliation Committee comprising representatives from the Parliament, Council, and Commission, who try to produce a joint proposal. If an agreement emerges, both Parliament and Council must give their approval with specific majorities. This setup means legislation can be halted by a variety of actors, so it’s easier to uphold existing laws than to introduce new ones. Budgetary rules use their own process. When a group of member states wants \"enhanced cooperation,\" the Council must approve it. The Commission must inform national governments before starting legislative proposals. Under TEU articles 4 and 5, the EU only has the powers assigned to it by the Treaties, and any remaining powers stay with the member states, though there’s ongoing dispute over who determines the limits of EU powers—national courts and parliaments often think it’s them, while the EU Court of Justice claims it should decide.",

While waiting, a fire broke out inside the cabin and spread rapidly due to the pure oxygen environment.

A strange smell in the astronauts’ spacesuits delayed closing the hatch. Communication failures then interrupted the simulated countdown. During this break, an electrical fire ignited in the cabin, spreading swiftly in the high-pressure, oxygen-rich air. The increasing pressure caused the cabin to burst, and the fire poured out onto the pad, making it difficult to save the astronauts, who died from lack of oxygen before the hatch could be opened.\n\nOn January 27, 1967, as the Apollo program conducted its plugs-out test, troubles emerged from the start. First, the astronauts noticed a peculiar odor in their suits, which postponed the hatch sealing. Communication problems followed, forcing the test to pause. During this pause, a fire broke out inside the spacecraft cabin, quickly spreading due to the pure oxygen under pressure. The intense heat and pressure caused the cabin to rupture, with the fire spilling out and hindering rescue attempts. The astronauts were overcome by the smoke and fire before help could arrive.",

Harvard economist Robert Barro discovered that there is \"little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment.\" His research from 1999 and 2000 suggests that while high inequality tends to decrease growth in poorer nations, it may actually boost growth in wealthier ones. For example, a study of Swedish counties from 1960 to 2000 showed that inequality had a positive effect on growth for up to five years, but this effect disappeared after a decade. Broader data analyses, however, have found no consistent link between inequality and growth over any fixed period, and they noted that inequality can shorten periods of economic expansion.\n\n2. According to research by Harvard's Robert Barro, there is not a strong connection between income inequality and economic growth or investment overall. His studies point out that high inequality slows growth in poor countries but can accelerate it in rich countries. An examination of Swedish counties from 1960-2000 found that inequality could boost growth in the short term (within five years), but this relationship doesn't last over a ten-year span. Other large-scale studies did not find any links between inequality and growth at any specific time point and observed that inequality often reduces the overall length of growth periods.\n\n3. Robert Barro, a Harvard economist, found little evidence that income inequality consistently affects economic growth or investment rates. He reported that while rising inequality tends to hamper growth in less wealthy countries, it seems to support growth in richer areas. A Swedish county-level study covering 1960 to 2000 showed that inequality was linked to higher growth for up to five years but not beyond ten years. Studies using bigger datasets generally found no fixed-time effects and indicated that inequality might shorten how long economic growth lasts.\n\n4. The relationship between income inequality and economic development is complex. Harvard's Robert Barro concluded that there isn't much of a connection between inequality and growth or investment rates overall. His research revealed that, although high inequality harms growth in poor countries, it can support growth in wealthy ones. A study of Swedish counties found that inequality had a positive impact on short-term growth, but this effect vanished after ten years.

Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries, as well as studying areas within countries. Daly et al. 2001 found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality.

Here are several different rewrites of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\nEconomic disparities have been linked to crime rates, particularly homicides, which are measured similarly across the globe. Numerous studies—over fifty—indicate that violence tends to be more frequent in societies with greater income inequality. These findings span both international comparisons and regional analyses within nations. For instance, Daly and colleagues (2001) observed that U.S. states and Canadian provinces with higher inequality experienced homicide rates up to ten times greater than less unequal regions. Their research suggests that up to half of the differences in homicide rates can be explained by income inequality alone. Likewise, Fajnzylber and others (2002) found a comparable link on a global scale. The academic literature frequently discusses this strong connection between homicide rates and economic inequality.\n\nResearch shows a connection between economic inequality and crime, especially homicide rates. Since homicides are consistently defined worldwide, they provide a reliable basis for study. In more than fifty studies, higher rates of violence appear where there is greater income disparity. Analysis has included both international and regional comparisons. Daly et al. (2001) discovered that among US states and Canadian provinces, places with the greatest inequality had homicide rates up to ten times higher than those with less. They estimated that roughly half the variation in homicide rates was due to income inequality. Similar conclusions were drawn worldwide by Fajnzylber et al. (2002). Academic discussions often highlight this relationship between crime and inequality.\n\nEconomic inequality has also been found to correlate with crime, as evidenced by research focusing mainly on homicides, which have similar definitions globally. More than fifty studies have shown that societies with larger income gaps are generally more violent. This relationship has been confirmed by examining both developed and developing countries, as well as different regions within a single country. Daly and colleagues (2001) demonstrated that US states and Canadian provinces with higher inequality saw a tenfold difference in homicide rates compared to their more equal counterparts, attributing about half the variation in murder rates to inequality. Similarly, Fajnzylber and team (2002) reported consistent results worldwide. The connection between homicide and inequality is frequently discussed in scholarly circles.\n\nCrime rates have been consistently associated with societal inequality, especially in regard to homicides, which are uniformly reported across nations. Over 50 studies suggest that societies with greater income disparities are likely to have higher rates of violence. Researchers have compared countries at various stages of development and have also examined regions within the same country. Daly and colleagues (2001) found that homicide rates in US states and Canadian provinces could be ten times higher in areas of greater inequality, attributing about half of the homicide rate differences to income inequality. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) reached a similar conclusion on a global scale. Academic literature often comments on the strong link between homicides and income inequality.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more rewrites or if you want a specific style!",

          "text": "Sure! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nPope Leo X, experienced in dealing with reformers and heretics, acted cautiously and slowly in response to Luther. Over three years, he sent various papal theologians and envoys to challenge Luther, which only strengthened Luther’s opposition to the papacy. Initially, Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini built a heresy case, prompting the pope to summon Luther to Rome. Elector Frederick, however, convinced the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg instead. There, during the 1518 Imperial Diet, Luther, under questioning by Cardinal Cajetan, declared that he did not view the papacy as part of the biblical Church, interpreting prophecies to identify the papacy with the Antichrist. This interpretation sparked major controversy. The hearings soon devolved into shouting. More than the publication of his 95 Theses, this confrontation made Luther a true adversary of the pope. Although Cajetan was supposed to arrest Luther if he refused to retract his statements, he refrained, and Luther managed to secretly leave Augsburg at night.\n\n2.  \nWhen Martin Luther challenged the authority of the papacy, Pope Leo X reacted with deliberate caution, having dealt with dissenters before. Over the next three years, the pope sent a succession of theologians and representatives to confront Luther, which only fueled Luther’s criticism of Rome. Sylvester Mazzolini, a Dominican, prepared charges of heresy, leading to a papal summons for Luther to appear in Rome. With the intervention of Elector Frederick, however, Luther’s hearing was relocated to Augsburg during the Imperial Diet. In October 1518, questioned by Cardinal Cajetan, Luther insisted the papacy wasn’t part of the biblical Church, interpreting scripture to suggest the pope was the Antichrist. This claim became a flashpoint for controversy, and the proceedings collapsed into argument. Luther’s dispute with church authorities, even more than his 95 Theses, branded him as an enemy of the pope. Although instructed to detain Luther if he didn’t recant, Cajetan let him go, and Luther escaped Augsburg at night without the cardinal’s knowledge.\n\n3.  \nPope Leo X, no stranger to reformers and heretics, handled Luther’s challenge cautiously. Over the next several years, he dispatched papal officials who only deepened Luther’s opposition to the Catholic hierarchy. The Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini accused Luther of heresy, prompting a papal summons to Rome; but Elector Frederick arranged for Luther’s questioning at Augsburg instead, during the 1518 Imperial Diet. There, facing Cardinal Cajetan, Luther argued the papacy was not a true part of the Church described in scripture, instead believing prophecy pointed to the papacy as the Antichrist. This interpretation caused significant controversy, and the hearing soon devolved into loud arguments. The confrontation, more than the 95 Theses, made Luther notorious as an opponent of the pope. While Cajetan was directed to detain Luther if he refused to withdraw his statements, he chose not to, and Luther slipped away from Augsburg unseen.\n\n4.  \nAfter Martin Luther’s challenge, Pope Leo X, accustomed to dissent, took careful and measured steps. Over three years he commissioned papal theologians and emissaries to address Luther’s criticisms, but their interventions only intensified Luther’s anti-papal beliefs. Dominican scholar Sylvester Mazzolini built a case against him, and Luther was called to Rome. Thanks to Elector Frederick’s persuasion, the hearing was moved to Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet assembled. In October 1518 at Augsburg, as Cardinal Cajetan pressed him, Luther argued that the papacy was not biblically based and, drawing on scriptural prophecy, called the papacy the Antichrist. This claim ignited widespread controversy and led to heated disputes at the hearing. The encounter with the church hierarchy, more than Luther’s publication of the 95 Theses, marked his emergence as a foe of the pope. Cajetan had the authority to arrest Luther for refusing to retract his views but decided otherwise, allowing Luther to secretly flee Augsburg under cover of night.",

The merging of all the tribal confederations under Genghis Khan ended infighting and established a strong, unified Mongol force.",

Here are several different rewrites of the given passage, each separated by a newline:\n\nFor a significant period, number theory—especially the investigation of prime numbers—was considered a classic instance of pure mathematics, pursued solely for curiosity’s sake, with little practical use except for the occasional application, such as using prime numbers for gear teeth to spread out wear. Mathematicians like the Briton G. H. Hardy took pride in their work being entirely detached from any military relevance. This viewpoint changed dramatically in the 1970s, when it became known that prime numbers could actually serve as the foundation for public key cryptography. Besides that, primes also find use in hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\n\nTraditionally, number theory, and specifically the study of prime numbers, was regarded as pure mathematics with minimal real-world uses, except in rare instances like prime-numbered gear teeth which help balance wear. Mathematicians such as G. H. Hardy were even proud of how irrelevant their work was to military or practical concerns. Yet, this perception was overturned in the 1970s when researchers revealed that prime numbers were crucial to building public key cryptography systems. Today, primes are also important in hash tables and generating pseudorandom numbers.\n\nNumber theory, and the focus on prime numbers in particular, was long viewed as a quintessential area of pure mathematics, valued only for intellectual inquiry, the lone exception being the use of prime-numbered gears to reduce uneven wear. Notably, mathematicians like G. H. Hardy boasted about the lack of any military applications for their research. This situation changed in the 1970s with the public discovery that prime numbers could be harnessed to develop public key cryptographic methods. Prime numbers now also support the design of hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\n\nFor centuries, the study of prime numbers exemplified pure mathematics, pursued mostly for intellectual satisfaction and seen as having almost no practical application—except, unusually, in gear designs using prime counts to prevent uneven wearing. Mathematicians such as G. H. Hardy even found pride in their theories serving no military function. This attitude was upended in the 1970s, however, when it emerged that prime numbers are fundamental to public key cryptography. Additionally, primes are now utilized in building hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.",

In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance. However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

When certain species like Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis, and Eurhamphaea vexilligera are disturbed, they emit glowing secretions, or \"ink,\" which shine at similar wavelengths as their own bodies. Juvenile ctenophores glow more intensely proportional to their size compared to adults, whose light is more diffuse. Extensive studies have not clarified the role of bioluminescence in ctenophores, nor have they found any link between the precise color of the light and environmental factors such as water depth or habitat type.\n\n2. Some ctenophore species, including Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis, and Eurhamphaea vexilligera, release luminescent secretions when disturbed, and these secretions glow at nearly the same wavelengths as their bodies. Young ctenophores exhibit a brighter luminescence for their size than adults do, with adults dispersing the light over a larger area. Careful statistical analysis has yet to reveal why ctenophores glow, or to associate the shade of their bioluminescence with environmental conditions like depth or locality in the ocean.\n\n3. Species such as Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis, and Eurhamphaea vexilligera, when agitated, produce glowing secretions that emit light similar in wavelength to their own bodies. Juveniles emit stronger light relative to their size compared to adults, who display a more diffuse luminescence. Comprehensive research has not uncovered the purpose of this bioluminescence in ctenophores or shown any relationship between its color and aspects of the environment, such as ocean depth or whether the animals inhabit coastal versus open ocean zones.\n\n4. In response to disturbance, certain ctenophores—among them Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis, and Eurhamphaea vexilligera—release luminous \"ink\" that glows at wavelengths very similar to their body light. Juvenile individuals glow more intensely for their size than do adults, who spread their glow over their entire body. Detailed analysis has failed to find an explanation for bioluminescence in these animals or a connection between its color and their specific environmental conditions, such as how deep they live or the type of water they inhabit.",

Eventually, the oppression grew so intense that some Muslim generals allied with Han Chinese to rebel against Mongol rule. The founder of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, had the support of Muslim generals such as Lan Yu, who helped defeat the Mongols. Some Muslim groups in China adopted a Chinese surname meaning \"barracks\" or \"thanks,\" which, according to many Hui Muslims, was a gesture of gratitude from the Han Chinese for their role in toppling the Yuan. Notably, Hui Muslim commander Feng Sheng fought for Zhu Yuanzhang against the Mongols. Another episode of resistance—the Ispah Rebellion—saw Muslims of the semu class rise up but ultimately be defeated and massacred by the Yuan loyalist Chen Youding.\n\n---\n\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Muslims held positions of authority, but faced significant discrimination, such as bans on their religious butchering practices and rituals. As their treatment worsened, Muslim military leaders joined forces with the Han Chinese to fight the Mongols. When Zhu Yuanzhang established the Ming dynasty, Muslim generals like Lan Yu contributed decisively to defeating the Mongols. Many Hui Muslims believe their Chinese surname meaning \"barracks,\" which can also signify \"thanks,\" was given to them as recognition for helping overthrow the Yuan. Among Zhu's armies was Hui Muslim Feng Sheng, who also participated in the fight. Meanwhile, the semu Muslims attempted their own revolt during the Ispah Rebellion, but were ultimately crushed and massacred by the Yuan commander Chen Youding.\n\n---\n\nUnder the Yuan dynasty, despite holding high office, Muslims faced severe restrictions such as being forbidden from practicing Halal and Kosher slaughter, as well as performing circumcisions, instead being compelled to eat according to Mongol customs. As oppression escalated, Muslim generals sided with Han Chinese rebels against the Mongol rulers. Zhu Yuanzhang, who founded the Ming dynasty, relied on Muslim generals like Lan Yu to defeat the Mongols. Some Muslim communities adopted a Chinese family name that translates as \"barracks\" or \"thanks,\" a reference, according to Hui Muslim tradition, to their significant contribution in the anti-Mongol uprising. Hui Muslim Feng Sheng also fought in Zhu Yuanzhang’s rebel army. Another revolt, the Ispah Rebellion, saw semu Muslims rise up against the Yuan, but they were ultimately defeated and many were killed by loyalist forces led by Chen Youding.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like more versions or a more concise summary!",

After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride. However, the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class \"white flight\" left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before.

The expansion of highways encouraged many residents to relocate to the suburbs. In response to this growth, city officials boosted spending on public infrastructure during the post-war economic boom. Under Mayor W. Haydon Burns' leadership and his initiative known as the Jacksonville Story, new municipal buildings like a city hall, civic auditorium, and public library were constructed, fostering community pride. Nevertheless, the rise of suburban development and middle-class \"white flight\" left Jacksonville with a diminished and poorer urban population. The percentage of non-Hispanic white residents dropped from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.\n\n2.  \nLike many large American cities, Jacksonville, Florida, faced the harmful impacts of urban sprawl after WWII. New highways made it easier for people to leave the city for suburban housing. After the war, Jacksonville’s government increased its budget for public buildings, spurred on by growth and initiatives like Mayor W. Haydon Burns’ Jacksonville Story, which resulted in new city landmarks and a renewed sense of civic pride. Despite these efforts, suburbanization and \"white flight\" led to a poorer and less populous inner city. As a result, the non-Hispanic white group, once the city’s largest, decreased from 75.8% of the population in 1970 to 55.1% in 2010.\n\n3.  \nAfter WWII, Jacksonville, Florida, was affected by urban sprawl when new highways encouraged people to leave the city for the suburbs. The city responded by investing in major public works projects, especially during the surge of growth after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns’ plan, called the Jacksonville Story, brought about the construction of important civic structures like a new city hall and a public library, which boosted local pride. However, as more people moved to the suburbs and \"white flight\" increased, the city was left with a poorer population and saw its non-Hispanic white demographic shrink dramatically—from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% in 2010.\n\n4.  \nUrban sprawl had a significant impact on Jacksonville, Florida, after World War II, as it did in many U.S. cities. New highways contributed to the growth of suburbs and drew residents away from downtown. In reaction, the local government increased spending to build new public facilities in the booming post-war years, a movement led by Mayor W. Haydon Burns through his Jacksonville Story initiative. Projects like a new city hall and civic auditorium aimed to revitalize the city and inspire pride. Despite these improvements, the city’s population grew poorer due to suburban expansion and the exodus of middle-class white residents, with non-Hispanic whites making up just 55.1% of the population by 2010, down from 75.8% in 1970.",

The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs. After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride. However, the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class \"white flight\" left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before. The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, declined from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

      "context": "While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

          "text": "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nAlthough the European Commission uniquely holds the right to propose new laws, both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union can modify or reject legislation as it moves through the legislative process. The Treaty on European Union, particularly articles 9 and 10, highlights the EU’s commitment to citizen equality and representative democracy. However, in practice, these ideals fall short because Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) cannot introduce legislation if the Commission objects, and citizens in the smallest countries wield disproportionately greater voting power compared to those in larger nations. Additionally, significant majorities or consensus in the Council are required to pass laws. This “democratic deficit” is often explained by the need for technocratic integration of European systems, especially before public understanding and acceptance caught up after World War II. Over time, the Parliament’s authority has grown: transitioning from an unelected body, to hosting direct elections starting in 1979, to having a stronger legislative voice. Even so, EU citizens enjoy fewer rights than they do within their own nations. Under TEU article 11, they can campaign and petition the Commission if supported by at least a million signatures, while TFEU article 227 allows them to petition the Parliament on issues affecting them. Parliament elections happen every five years by proportional representation or the single transferable vote method, allocating 750 MEPs in a way that favors smaller states (\"degressive proportionality\"). This setup means citizens of smaller countries have a bigger say in Parliament than those of larger ones. MEPs typically align with political party groups, with the European People’s Party and the Party of European Socialists leading the major coalitions. Political parties are not funded by the EU, after a court ruling that such financing is a matter for national regulation. Parliament can investigate maladministration, appoint an Ombudsman, demand responses from the Commission, and even force the Commission’s resignation with a two-thirds vote, as happened in 1999. While Parliament holds some consultation rights in legislation, it ultimately relies on the Commission and Council to pass laws, which limits the direct democratic power of EU citizens: real legislative authority does not rest solely with the people’s elected representatives.\n\n2.  \nThe European Commission is alone responsible for starting new laws in the EU, but both the Parliament and the Council have the power to amend or veto proposed legislation. The EU’s founding treaties promise equality and representative democracy, but these principles are compromised. Parliamentarians cannot introduce laws without the Commission’s backing, and people in smaller countries have much more voting influence than those in larger ones. Passing EU laws also requires large majorities or consensus in the Council. This situation, commonly referred to as a “democratic deficit,” was originally rationalized by the need for experts to coordinate European integration after WWII, while public engagement was still low. Since then, the Parliament has gained more influence: first becoming directly elected in 1979 and gradually expanding its legislative rights. Nonetheless, EU citizens have fewer democratic rights than in their national systems. They can submit issues to the Commission with a million signatures, or petition the Parliament directly on matters that impact them. Parliamentary elections happen every five years, with seats distributed disproportionately to benefit smaller countries, giving their citizens louder voices. The Parliament's members are organized primarily along party lines, with the European People’s Party currently in the majority, and the Party of European Socialists in opposition. EU institutions do not fund these parties, following a court ruling that such things are left to the member states. Parliament’s powers include investigating wrongdoing, appointing an Ombudsman, questioning the Commission, and, with a sufficient majority, dismissing the Commission—something which last happened in 1999. Despite all these roles, the Parliament remains dependent on the Commission and Council for legislation, meaning ultimate legislative authority does not rest directly with the people’s elected representatives.\n\n3.  \nIn EU lawmaking, only the European Commission can formally propose legislation, though both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union can make changes or block these proposals. The EU, as laid out in its Treaties, aspires to citizen equality and representative democracy, yet practices often deviate from these ideals. MEPs cannot introduce new legislation without the Commission, and citizens from small member states have far more voting power in Parliament compared to those from large member states. Passage of most legislation requires a qualified majority or consensus in the Council. The historic rationale for this so-called “democratic deficit” has been the technical and economic integration managed by experts, allowing time for greater public understanding post-WWII. Parliament’s influence has increased over time, transitioning from a nominated body, to holding EU-wide elections in 1979, to accruing more legislative sway. Citizens’ rights to participate directly are still limited; under TEU article 11 they can promote their views and initiate proposals if they gather a million signatures, and under TFEU article 227 they can submit petitions relevant to their concerns. Parliamentary elections occur every five years with proportional representation, but seat numbers are adjusted so that smaller member states are overrepresented. Thus, people in less populous states have more say than those in larger ones. Political groups like the European People’s Party and the Party of European Socialists dominate MEP alignments. Funding for these parties does not come from the EU itself, as national regulation determines such matters. Parliament is empowered to probe EU administration, appoint an Ombudsman, question the Commission, and, with a supermajority, dismiss the Commission, as happened in 1999. It has some rights to consultation in legislative drafting, but lacks the final say; real legislative power remains split between the Commission and Council, meaning the EU’s democratic foundations are not as robust as those of its individual members.",

          "text": "1.  \nThe Social Chapter is a section in the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam that addresses social policy within European Union law. Its foundation was laid in 1989 by key \"social partner\" organizations: UNICE (representing employers), the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), and the European Centre of Public Enterprises (CEEP). A less ambitious version was adopted as the Social Charter during the 1989 Strasbourg European Council. The Charter outlines 30 general principles, covering areas such as fair pay, workplace health and safety, the rights of disabled and elderly persons, workers' rights, vocational training, and improved living standards. These principles inspired around 40 legislative acts within the European Community.\n\n2.  \nWithin the scope of European Union law, the Social Chapter—added to the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam—deals with matters of social policy. The initial framework for the Social Chapter was created by \"social partners\" in 1989, including the employer organization UNICE, the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), and the European Centre of Public Enterprises (CEEP). That same year, a scaled-down version was agreed upon at the Strasbourg European Council as the Social Charter, which sets out 30 broad principles. These principles address topics such as fair employment pay, health and safety at work, protections for disabled and elderly people, workers’ rights, vocational education, and better living conditions. The Social Charter provided the foundation for 40 pieces of European Community legislation in these areas.\n\n3.  \nThe Social Chapter, which forms part of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, focuses on social policy in the context of European Union law. It originated in 1989 when representatives of employers, trade unions (ETUC), and public enterprises (CEEP) known as the \"social partners,\" established its groundwork. A milder form, known as the Social Charter, was officially adopted at the Strasbourg European Council of 1989. The Charter articulates 30 overarching principles, including the right to fair wages, safe workplace conditions, the protection of the disabled and elderly, workers' rights, access to vocational training, and the promotion of better living standards. This Charter later served as the basis for forty legislative measures in the European Community.\n\n4.  \nEuropean Union law includes the Social Chapter, which was introduced through the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam to address social policies. The concept was built in 1989 by major stakeholder representatives—namely employers (UNICE), trade unions (ETUC), and public enterprises (CEEP)—known collectively as \"social partners.\" That year, a more moderate version was adopted as the Social Charter at the Strasbourg European Council. The Charter lists 30 main principles, such as fair pay, workplace safety, rights for vulnerable groups like the disabled and elderly, workers' rights, vocational training, and the enhancement of living standards. These principles influenced 40 legislative acts within the European Community.",

Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.

In bright light, chloroplasts line up vertically along the cell wall or turn to minimize the amount of light hitting them, protecting themselves from damage caused by too much light. This capacity to either cluster together or spread out may explain why terrestrial plants have lots of small chloroplasts, rather than just a few large ones. The movement of chloroplasts is one of the most precisely managed responses in plants. Interestingly, mitochondria have been seen following the motions of chloroplasts.\n\n2.  \nIn response to changing light conditions, chloroplasts within plant and algal cells move to optimize light absorption. During dim light, they expand into a sheet-like arrangement to maximize exposure. Conversely, in strong light, they shield themselves by forming vertical lines or orienting sideways, thus reducing their exposure and protecting against light-induced damage. This ability to reposition may be why land plants typically have many small chloroplasts rather than just a handful of large ones. The system controlling chloroplast movement is among the most tightly regulated in plants, and mitochondria are known to trail their movements.\n\n3.  \nPlant and algal cell chloroplasts can reorient themselves depending on how much light is present. Under low-light conditions, they fan out to absorb as much light as possible, but in very bright light, they align vertically or turn so only their sides face the incoming light, thus reducing the amount they absorb and preventing photooxidative damage. This self-protective movement, allowing them to either cluster together or spread out, may be why land plants have evolved numerous small chloroplasts instead of a few large ones. The way chloroplasts adjust their position is one of the most carefully controlled actions in plants. Mitochondria have also been seen to follow the paths of moving chloroplasts.\n\n4.  \nChloroplasts in the cells of plants and algae can rearrange themselves according to light conditions—spreading out thinly under low light to maximize light capture, or stacking up vertically or turning edgewise when light is too intense, which helps limit their exposure and protect them from damage. This flexible organization, allowing chloroplasts to either shelter or distribute themselves as needed, might be why land plants have many smaller chloroplasts rather than just a few bigger ones.

A July 23, 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Because different inputs of the same size may require different amounts of time, we consider the worst-case time complexity, T(n), which is the maximum time needed for any input of length n. An algorithm is considered to run in polynomial time if T(n) is a polynomial function of n. According to Cobham's thesis, a problem is considered efficiently solvable if there exists a polynomial time algorithm for it.\n\n2.  \nComputational complexity theory analyzes how the running time of an algorithm grows with the input size n, expressing this time as a function of n. Since not all inputs of size n take the same time, the worst-case time complexity, T(n), is defined as the greatest time required for any input of that size. An algorithm is referred to as a polynomial time algorithm if T(n) can be bounded by a polynomial in n. Cobham's thesis suggests that problems solvable in polynomial time are considered feasible in terms of resources.\n\n3.  \nIn the realm of computational complexity theory, the time an algorithm takes is described as a function of the input size, denoted by n. Because some inputs may be more time-consuming than others, the worst-case time complexity T(n) represents the longest time the algorithm might take for any input of size n. If this T(n) is a polynomial, the method qualifies as a polynomial time algorithm. Cobham's thesis states that if a problem has such an algorithm, then it is solvable with reasonable or practical resources.\n\n4.  \nComputational complexity theory considers the amount of time an algorithm uses as a function of n, the size of the input.

Here are several rewritten versions of the passage:\n\n1.  \nThe international growth of ABC took off for a second time during the 1990s with ESPN's global expansion and was further driven in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks. During this period, Disney grew its American cable networks like Disney Channel, Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix abroad, although it also sold its 33% share in the European sports network Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000. Unlike Disney’s other channels, ABC is mainly broadcast in the U.S., though its shows are syndicated globally. The idea of fully-owned international networks was revisited in 2004 when ABC launched ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the UK. However, Disney ended ABC1’s operation in October 2007 due to low viewer numbers, effectively putting an end to efforts at developing an overseas ABC network.\n\n2.  \nABC experienced another stage of global expansion in the 1990s due in part to ESPN’s reach, later enhanced by Disney Media Networks’ strategies in the 2000s. While Disney expanded its American networks such as the Disney Channel and its related offshoots internationally, it also sold a significant interest in Eurosport, exiting with $155 million in June 2000. Although ABC broadcasts exclusively in the U.S., its programs are distributed in several foreign markets. The attempt to operate fully owned channels internationally reemerged in 2004 with the launch of ABC1 in the UK, but after failing to gain a steady audience, the channel was closed in October 2007, ending these international ambitions.\n\n3.  \nIn the 1990s, ABC began a second wave of international expansion, particularly through the ESPN network. This continued into the 2000s as Disney Media Networks pushed to grow Disney’s American cable channels—such as Disney Channel and its spin-offs—while also pulling back in Europe by selling a 33% stake in Eurosport for $155 million in mid-2000. Whereas ABC is primarily a U.S. network, its shows are also syndicated overseas. The idea of launching fully owned international channels resurfaced in 2004 with ABC1’s debut in the UK, but the channel was shut down in October 2007 due to low viewership, and efforts to create an ABC International presence were halted.\n\n4.  \nA second international expansion for ABC occurred thanks to ESPN’s growth in the 1990s and new strategies by Disney Media Networks in the 2000s, which saw U.S. channels like Disney Channel and its subsidiaries extend their reach. At the same time, Disney sold off its 33% stake in Eurosport in June 2000 for $155 million. ABC itself is only broadcast domestically, though its content is licensed worldwide. Disney returned to the idea of owning international networks in 2004 with the UK-based ABC1 channel, but after struggling to draw viewers, ABC1 was discontinued in late 2007, closing the chapter on ABC’s direct international broadcast efforts.\n\nLet me know if you need more options or further simplifications!",

This principle, often known as the action-reaction law, labels F as the “action” and -F as the equally-timed “reaction”.\n\n2.  \nNewton’s Third Law states that forces are always the result of interactions between objects—there are no forces that affect only one body. When one object exerts a force F on another, that second object exerts a force of -F back on the first. These forces are always equal in strength and opposite in direction. This is frequently summarized as the action-reaction law, meaning the action (F) and the reaction (−F) occur at the same time.\n\n3.  \nBy applying the idea of symmetry, Newton’s Third Law reveals that forces always involve interactions between two objects. There can never be a one-way force acting on only one object. When a force F is exerted by one object on another, the second object simultaneously applies a force of -F on the first. Both are equal and opposite. Often, this is called the action-reaction law, with the two forces occurring at the same instant and countering each other.",

On May 18, 1756, while all this was happening, Britain officially declared war on France, turning the broader struggle into what would eventually be called the Seven Years’ War.\n\n3.  \nIn January 1756, Lord Loudoun replaced the previous British leader, with Major General James Abercrombie supporting him. Unlike the French officers sent to North America, neither British commander had much experience in military campaigns. The French strengthened their position with reinforcements led by Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and his able deputies, the Chevalier de Lévis and Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, all veterans of previous European wars. That same month in Europe, England formally declared war on France on May 18, 1756, escalating the conflict into the broader Seven Years’ War.\n\n4.  \nAfter Newcastle was replaced in January 1756, Lord Loudoun and Major General James Abercrombie assumed command for the British in North America, but they lacked the extensive war experience of the French officers. France sent seasoned leaders—Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, the Chevalier de Lévis, and Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque—all veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession—with reinforcements to New France in May 1756. Meanwhile, on May 18, 1756, Britain declared war on France, transforming the conflict into the larger European struggle known as the Seven Years’ War.",

The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The Eighth Doctor's TV movie used a revised version of the logo that originated with the Third Doctor. From 1973 to 1980, a particular logo distinguished the Third Doctor's last season and most of the Fourth Doctor's episodes. The next logo, though closely linked with the Fifth Doctor, was actually introduced during the Fourth Doctor’s final season. The Ninth Doctor’s logo required only minor edits for the Tenth Doctor, maintaining a similar style. For the Eleventh Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol was shifted to the right in 2012, but while the font stayed consistent, its texture was updated each episode to match the story. In the Twelfth Doctor’s era, the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol was dropped, and the logo’s font was subtly refined and made a bit larger. As of 2014, the Third and Eighth Doctors’ logo serves as the main logo for classic Doctor merchandise, while the contemporary logo represents the current Doctor in all official merchandise.\n\n2.  \nThe original Doctor Who logo, initially designed for the First Doctor and briefly for the Second, reappeared in a modified form during the Eleventh Doctor's era in the 50th anniversary special, \"The Day of the Doctor.\" An updated version of the Third Doctor’s logo was chosen for the Eighth Doctor's TV film. From 1973 through 1980, a specific logo was prominent during the final season of the Third Doctor and for most of the Fourth Doctor's stories. The subsequent logo, though usually tied to the Fifth Doctor, also made its debut in the Fourth Doctor's final run. For the Ninth Doctor, the existing logo was only slightly revised for the Tenth Doctor. With the Eleventh Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia was positioned on the right side in 2012, with the font mostly unchanged but the texture being refreshed to reflect each episode’s narrative. The Twelfth Doctor’s logo omitted the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol, made the font a little bigger, and altered it subtly. Since 2014, the historically iconic logo from the Third and Eighth Doctors has been used for all legacy Doctor merchandise, while merchandise for the current Doctor features the latest version of the logo.\n\n3.  \nFor the First Doctor, and briefly the Second, the show’s original logo was used, and this design appeared again in a slightly updated form for the Eleventh Doctor’s 50th anniversary special, \"The Day of the Doctor.\" The Eighth Doctor’s movie used a revised version of the Third Doctor's logo. Between 1973 and 1980, a distinctive logo was used during the Third Doctor’s concluding series and through much of the Fourth Doctor’s tenure. The next logo is most linked to the Fifth Doctor, though it originated during the final season of the Fourth. The logo for the Ninth Doctor was only minimally altered for his successor, the Tenth Doctor. With the Eleventh Doctor, the TARDIS-shaped \"DW\" logo was moved to the right in 2012, with minor font changes and a new story-related texture each episode. The Twelfth Doctor's era dropped the \"DW\" symbol and introduced a slightly enlarged and refined font. From 2014 onwards, the retro logo from the Third and Eighth Doctors represents all classic Doctor-related media and merchandise, while the current series uses its own up-to-date logo for contemporary Doctor items.\n\n4.  \nThe Doctor Who logo that debuted with the First Doctor, and was briefly used for the Second, was later reintroduced in a modified way for the Eleventh Doctor's \"The Day of the Doctor\" special. The Eighth Doctor’s TV movie saw an updated version of the Third Doctor’s logo. Between 1973 and 1980, a specific logo defined the end of the Third Doctor's era and most of the Fourth Doctor’s time. While the Fifth Doctor is most associated with the following logo, it first appeared during the Fourth Doctor's final episodes. For Doctors Nine and Ten, the logo saw only minor adjustments. Under the Eleventh Doctor, the TARDIS-styled \"DW\" graphic was relocated to the right, accompanied by slight font and texture updates reflecting each storyline. The Twelfth Doctor’s version removed the \"DW\" symbol and enhanced the font. Since 2014, the logo shared by the Third and Eighth Doctors serves as the standard for all classic Doctor Who merchandise, while the current Doctor’s products bear the latest logo.\n\nLet me know if you want any more rewrites or a particular style!",

Lay servants are not clergy, but they sometimes lead worship services and deliver sermons when ordained ministers or deacons are not available. There are two types: local church lay servants, who serve in their own congregations, and certified lay servants, who may serve in other churches and take part in larger church-related projects. To become a local church lay servant, a person needs a recommendation from their pastor and church council, and must complete a basic course. This status requires an annual reapplication, with a report on their service and learning. Certified lay servants must also be recommended, complete both a basic and an advanced course, and pass an interview with a district committee. They must reapply each year and complete an advanced course at least every three years.\n\n**Rewritten passage 2:**  \nWithin the United Methodist Church, lay servants play an important part despite not being considered part of the clergy. They are called upon to preach when ordained leaders are unavailable. Lay servants fall into two groups: local church lay servants, who serve within their home church, and certified lay servants, who can serve more broadly. To qualify as a local church lay servant, one must get endorsements from both their pastor and church council, finish the basic lay servant course, and reapply annually with a record of their activities and learning. Certified lay servants, in addition, must complete an advanced course, undergo an interview with a higher committee, report and reapply every year, and take an advanced course at least once every three years.\n\n**Rewritten passage 3:**  \nThe United Methodist Church designates some members as lay servants, who are laypeople that help lead worship when ordained ministers are not present. Lay servants include local church lay servants, who serve in their own congregations, and certified lay servants, who may serve elsewhere or participate in larger church initiatives. Becoming a local church lay servant requires a pastor and council’s recommendation and completion of a basic course, with annual renewal needed. Certified lay servants must fulfill those requirements plus an advanced course and an interview, and they must continue their training by taking advanced courses every three years.",

Here are several rewrites of the given passage, each in a different style or structure:\n\n1.  \nTeachers achieve their goals by using either informal or formal teaching methods, such as structured lesson plans and courses, to provide knowledge, skills, or critical thinking abilities. The various methods used are known as pedagogy. In choosing the appropriate teaching strategy, teachers take into account the students’ previous knowledge, the learning environment, their educational objectives, and guidelines from official curricula. Teachers also support students’ learning beyond classroom walls, often through field trips. The rise of the internet and technology in recent years has significantly impacted the way teachers fulfill their responsibilities.\n\n2.  \nEducators typically reach their teaching objectives through planned or improvised approaches, often involving a curriculum and lesson strategies that develop students’ abilities and understanding. The term “pedagogy” describes these differing teaching techniques. When selecting the best instructional method, teachers weigh students’ existing knowledge, educational setting, and learning aims, along with state or district curriculum requirements. Additionally, teachers often enhance learning with extracurricular experiences like field trips. Modern technology, especially the widespread use of the internet in the last decade, has started to influence how teachers perform their jobs.\n\n3.  \nAchieving educational goals usually relies on formal courses or informal methods, both encompassing lesson planning to impart knowledge, skills, or problem-solving abilities. These varied approaches fall under the umbrella of pedagogy. Teachers select their methods based on factors such as what students already know, their surroundings, intended outcomes, and mandated curricula. Beyond teaching in classrooms, teachers may also organize field trips to foster learning. Technological advancements, particularly the internet’s growth, have played a key role in transforming teaching practices recently.\n\n4.  \nTo meet learning objectives, teachers use strategies that range from formal lesson plans to informal guidance, passing on knowledge, skills, and critical thinking. This practice is called pedagogy. Teachers choose their teaching methods by considering students’ prior experiences, classroom settings, educational targets, and curriculum standards set by authorities. Often, they provide additional learning opportunities, like field trips outside of school. Technology, especially the internet, has increasingly influenced how teachers interact with and educate students.\n\n5.  \nTeachers commonly attain their teaching aims through formal coursework or by using more relaxed, informal teaching styles, all designed to build knowledge or thinking skills in students. Such approaches are collectively called pedagogy. In determining which method to use, teachers look at students’ backgrounds, their environment, intended achievements, and curriculum standards. Often, learning extends beyond the classroom via activities such as field trips.

Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law.

Martin Luther, in his arguments against the antinomians, reiterates the importance of the \"second use of the law.\" This is the idea that the law serves as an instrument of the Holy Spirit to produce sorrow for sin in people, making them ready to receive Christ’s fulfillment of the law through the gospel. Luther explains that anything evoking sorrow over sin is considered the law—whether it’s Christ’s life, His death for humanity’s sins, or even the experience of God’s goodness in creation. Therefore, simply choosing not to preach the Ten Commandments within the church doesn’t erase the law’s accusing power. Saying that no form of the law should be preached to Christians would be like claiming Christians are free from sin and that the church is made up only of perfectly holy people.\n\n2. In his disputes with antinomians, Martin Luther stresses the “second use of the law”—that the law acts as the Spirit’s tool to create remorse for sin, readying people for the gospel’s promise of Christ fulfilling the law. He maintains that any means causing awareness of sin is functionally the law, whether it comes from the story of Christ’s life, His sacrificial death, or the blessings of creation. Thus, eliminating the Ten Commandments from church sermons does not remove the presence or the work of the law. To suggest Christians no longer need to hear the law is to claim they have no more sin and that the church is a gathering of flawless individuals.\n\n3. When addressing the antinomians, Luther upholds what is known as the law’s “second use”—its role, through the Spirit, of convicting people of sin and guiding them toward Christ’s redemption. Luther regards anything that sparks sorrow over wrongdoing, whether it stems from Christ’s actions, His death, or the goodness found in creation, as fulfilling the law’s purpose. He argues that refraining from teaching the Ten Commandments does not make the law disappear from the lives of believers. Insisting that the law has no place in Christian preaching effectively denies that Christians still struggle with sin and suggests that the church is made up only of entirely saintly people.",

Among Kublai Khan's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer Guo Shoujing, who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the Yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year, which was only 26 seconds off the modern Gregorian calendar's measurement. Road and water communications were reorganized and improved. To provide against possible famines, granaries were ordered built throughout the empire. The city of Beijing was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes, hills and mountains, and parks. During the Yuan period, Beijing became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China, which was completely renovated. These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Asia and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe. Chinese travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering. Contacts with the West also brought the introduction to China of a major food crop, sorghum, along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine.

          "text": "**1.**  \nSteam engines usually have two separate safety features to prevent the boiler pressure from becoming too high. One mechanism is user-adjustable, while the other is built as a last-resort safeguard. Traditionally, safety valves consisted of a simple lever holding down a plug valve on top of the boiler, with a weight or spring on one end to keep the valve closed against the steam. Early on, drivers could adjust these valves themselves, but this sometimes led to accidents when operators tightened the valve to increase steam pressure for more engine power. Modern safety valves, however, use a spring-loaded design that locks in place and can't be adjusted without breaking a seal, making them significantly safer.[citation needed]\n\n**2.**  \nTo prevent boiler overpressure, steam engines are commonly equipped with two independent safety systems: one that users can adjust and another that acts as a backup in case the first fails. In the past, a straightforward lever mechanism held a plug valve shut at the boiler's top, using a weight or spring for resistance. Because early versions could easily be modified by drivers, there were incidents where increased steam pressure caused accidents. Nowadays, a more secure, adjustable spring-based safety valve is used, designed such that tampering requires breaking an illegal seal, which greatly improves safety.[citation needed]\n\n**3.**  \nMost steam engines incorporate two distinct mechanisms to keep boiler pressure from rising too much; one is intended for adjustment by the operator, while the other serves as a final safety measure. Traditionally, a simple lever system with a weight or spring was used to hold a plug valve closed. This setup, however, allowed engine drivers to increase the steam pressure by fastening the valve more tightly, occasionally leading to hazardous situations. The latest safety valves employ a lockable, spring-loaded mechanism that cannot be changed without breaking a seal, providing a much safer solution.[citation needed]\n\n**4.**  \nSteam engines often feature a pair of independent safeguards to stop boiler pressure from exceeding safe limits. The user can adjust the first, while the second is a fixed, ultimate safety device. Older steam engine safety valves relied on a lever and weight (or spring) to hold down a plug valve on top of the boiler. Because earlier designs could be altered by drivers seeking more power, this sometimes led to dangerous accidents. The modern spring-loaded safety valve is both adjustable and sealed so that tampering requires breaking a seal—this has greatly enhanced safety.[citation needed]",

President Kennedy's science advisor, Jerome Wiesner, who had previously opposed both manned space missions and the Moon landing, brought in Golovin—who had left NASA—to head a \"Space Vehicle Panel.\" This panel was apparently meant to review NASA's choices, but in reality, it often questioned their decisions about the Saturn V rocket and the lunar orbit rendezvous method. As a result, NASA officials like Shea, Seamans, and Webb had to justify themselves extensively, which delayed the official announcement until July 11, 1962, with Webb still calling the decision \"tentative.\"\n\n2.  \nEven after NASA found agreement within its own ranks, many obstacles remained. Kennedy's science advisor, Jerome Wiesner, who was known for opposing manned missions and the lunar landing, recruited Golovin—formerly of NASA—to lead a so-called \"Space Vehicle Panel.\" This panel was supposed to supervise, but actually aimed to challenge NASA's choices concerning the Saturn V and lunar landing strategies, requiring figures like Shea, Seamans, and Webb to repeatedly defend their positions. This led to a postponement of the public announcement until July 11, 1962, and forced Webb to describe the decision as still \"tentative.\"\n\n3.  \nDespite coming to a decision internally, NASA's path was still fraught with trouble. Jerome Wiesner, Kennedy's science advisor and a critic of both manned spaceflight and the Moon landing, brought back ex-NASA member Golovin to lead a \"Space Vehicle Panel.\" While this body was allegedly tasked with oversight, its real purpose was to re-examine NASA's approaches to the Saturn V and lunar rendezvous, putting Shea, Seamans, and Webb in the position of having to continually justify their decisions. This scrutiny stalled the announcement to the media until July 11, 1962, and left Webb describing the outcome as merely \"tentative.\"\n\n4.  \nInternal agreement at NASA didn't guarantee a smooth process. Kennedy’s science advisor, Jerome Wiesner, a known opponent of manned lunar missions, enlisted Golovin, who had left NASA, to lead a new \"Space Vehicle Panel.\" The stated intent was oversight, but the real aim seemed to be to challenge NASA's planning for the Saturn V and lunar orbit rendezvous. This forced top officials like Shea, Seamans, and Webb to defend their choices, delaying a public statement until July 11, 1962, with Webb still saying the decision was only \"tentative.\"",

On September 30, 1960, ABC debuted *The Flintstones*, an animated show created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Even though the series was produced in color, it originally aired in black-and-white because ABC hadn't yet upgraded its equipment to support color broadcasts. *The Flintstones* marked a new era by introducing animated programming to prime-time television and helped ABC replace the family programming void left after its partnership with Disney ended.\n\n2.  \nThe 1960s were a transformative period for ABC, as the network focused on airing more family-oriented shows to compete with other broadcasters, while also moving toward showcasing color television. A notable example of this was the premiere of *The Flintstones* on September 30, 1960. Although the show was created in color by Hanna and Barbera, ABC initially aired it in black-and-white, due to the lack of technical equipment for color broadcasting. This strategy not only introduced prime-time animated content but also helped ABC compensate for the loss of Disney-produced family programming.\n\n3.  \nABC's strategy in the 1960s centered on countering its rivals with family-based series and slowly transitioning its broadcasts from black-and-white to color. When *The Flintstones* launched on September 30, 1960, it became one of the earliest animated series intended for prime-time audiences. Despite being produced in color, viewers first saw it in black-and-white, since ABC's infrastructure wasn't yet ready for color TV. Bringing *The Flintstones* to its lineup helped ABC appeal to families and fill a gap left by the end of its association with Disney.\n\n4.  \nIn the 1960s, ABC aimed to outdo established networks by featuring more shows suited for families and adopting color technology. A milestone was reached with the debut of *The Flintstones* on September 30, 1960, created by Hanna and Barbera.

On September 30, 1960, ABC premiered The Flintstones, another example of counterprogramming; although the animated series from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was filmed in color from the beginning, it was initially broadcast in black-and-white, as ABC had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time. The Flintstones allowed ABC to present a novelty, that of prime-time animated programming, but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the Disney partnership by carrying family-oriented programming from other producers.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The LM's engines were both test-fired and restarted as planned, although a programming mistake caused the initial descent stage burn to end sooner than intended. During the mission, the ascent engine was used in an abort scenario called a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, igniting at the same time as the descent stage was jettisoned.

This grace gives us the ability to love and inspires us to pursue a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. It represents God’s active effort to draw us away from our sinful tendencies and towards the loving purpose of the Father. Through this grace, God wants us to recognize both our own sin and His gift of salvation. Prevenient grace makes it possible for people affected by sin to freely decide whether to accept or reject the salvation offered in Christ.\n\n2.  \nThe United Methodist Church teaches that prevenient grace is the grace of God that reaches out to every person before they are even aware of it. This grace empowers us to love and leads us to seek fellowship with God through Jesus Christ. It is through prevenient grace that God works in our hearts, turning us from sinful desires to align with His loving will. By this means, God helps us understand our own sinfulness and extends the possibility of salvation. Despite the presence of sin, prevenient grace grants us genuine freedom to choose whether to accept or refuse God’s saving offer in Christ.\n\n3.  \nWithin the United Methodist faith, prevenient grace refers to God’s grace that acts ahead of us, available to all. It’s the force that helps us to love and encourages us to form a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. Prevenient grace is God’s ongoing effort to steer us away from self-centered willfulness toward the loving intentions of the Father. Through this grace, God wants us to become aware of our own sin and His invitation to salvation. Prevenient grace makes it possible for everyone, even those impacted by sin, to make a free and conscious decision to accept or turn away from God’s salvation in Christ.\n\n4.  \nIn Methodist theology, prevenient grace is the idea that God provides grace to all people even before they seek Him. This grace empowers us to love and stirs our desire to know God through Jesus Christ. It represents God’s current action to move us away from the effects of our sinful nature and into alignment with the loving will of the Father. Through prevenient grace, God wants us to recognize both how we fall short and how He extends salvation to us. This grace gives everyone, despite being marked by sin, the freedom to choose whether to accept or reject the salvation offered in Jesus.\n\n5.  \nThe United Methodist Church believes in prevenient grace—the grace which comes before any human action and is given freely to all. This grace enables us to love and moves us to seek a relationship with God in Jesus Christ. Through prevenient grace, God is at work in our lives, turning us from sinful desires toward the love and will of the Father. With this grace, God helps us realize our sinful state and the salvation He offers. Even though we are affected by sin, prevenient grace gives us the true freedom to choose whether to accept or deny God’s gift of salvation in Christ.",

Kenyatta, who traveled with 60 Kenyan business leaders, sought Chinese backing for major infrastructure projects, including a $2.5 billion railway from Mombasa to Uganda and a nearly $1.8 billion dam, as outlined in a statement from his office. Around that time, Base Titanium, an Australian firm’s subsidiary, sent its first big shipment of minerals—25,000 tonnes of ilmenite—from Kilifi to China, projected to generate Shs15–20 billion for Kenya. However, China’s activities have also caused social and environmental issues, as illustrated by the recent suspension of the railway project.\n\n**2.**  \nLiu Guangyuan, China’s ambassador to Kenya, shared on Capital FM’s website during President Kenyatta’s 2013 Beijing trip that Chinese investments in Kenya tallied $474 million, marking China as the country’s leading foreign investor, while bilateral trade between the two countries was $2.84 billion in 2012. Kenyatta was accompanied by 60 Kenyan business people and looked to gain China’s support for a $2.5 billion railway project from Mombasa to Uganda and a $1.8 billion dam, according to a presidential statement. At the same time, Base Titanium, an Australian-owned company, sent its first large mineral cargo—25,000 tonnes of ilmenite—from Kilifi to China, expecting to bring Kenya Shs15-20 billion. These increasing Chinese investments have not been without problems, including environmental and social issues that led to the halting of the railway project.\n\n**3.**  \nDuring President Kenyatta’s 2013 visit to Beijing, Liu Guangyuan, the Chinese ambassador to Kenya, announced on Capital FM’s website that Chinese investment in Kenya hit $474 million, making China Kenya’s largest source of foreign direct investment, with bilateral trade rising to $2.84 billion in 2012. Kenyatta traveled with 60 business people hoping for Chinese backing for a $2.5 billion railway from Mombasa to Uganda, and a $1.8 billion dam, as per a statement from his office. Meanwhile, Base Titanium shipped its first major batch of minerals, 25,000 tonnes of ilmenite, from Kilifi to China, aiming to earn Kenya between Shs15 and Shs20 billion. However, China’s increasing involvement has sparked several environmental and social problems, leading to the railway project’s suspension.\n\n**4.**  \nIn 2013, as President Kenyatta visited Beijing, China’s ambassador Liu Guangyuan told Kenya’s Capital FM site that Chinese investment in Kenya reached $474 million and trade between the two nations hit $2.84 billion the previous year. The president, accompanied by 60 Kenyan businesspeople, sought China’s help for a proposed $2.5 billion railway from Mombasa to Uganda and a $1.8 billion dam, according to a statement from his office during the trip. Around that period, Base Titanium, a division of Australia’s Base Resources, shipped 25,000 tonnes of ilmenite from Kilifi to China, which was expected to bring in Shs15–20 billion for Kenya. However, China’s significant presence has also led to social and environmental challenges, like the suspension of the railway project.",

The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

As the French and Indian War began, the French leveraged their trade networks to enlist Great Lakes tribes such as the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi, even though these groups were not directly involved in the conflict between France and Britain. The British received support from the Iroquois Six Nations and, initially, the Cherokee, but a split led to the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. That same year, Pennsylvania secured the Treaty of Easton, gaining neutrality from several Ohio Country tribes in return for land concessions and other promises. Many northern tribes allied with the French, who were their main trade partners and arms suppliers. Both the French and British vied for alliances or neutrality from the Creek and Cherokee through diplomacy. However, because many tribes were loosely organized, small groups sometimes fought independently, even against the terms of formal treaties.\n\n2.  \nThe interior Southeast was home to prominent tribes like the Catawba, Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee, each speaking various native languages. When the war erupted, the French recruited warriors from the Great Lakes area, such as the Huron and Potawatomi, drawing on their trading relationships, even though these tribes weren't directly involved in the main conflict. On the British side, support came from the Iroquois Six Nations and originally the Cherokee, until disagreements triggered the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. That year, the Treaty of Easton brought neutrality from some Ohio Country tribes after Pennsylvania negotiated land and other benefits for them. Most remaining northern tribes partnered with the French, who supplied them with weapons and trade goods. The Creek and Cherokee were the subjects of French and British diplomatic maneuvering aimed at securing their support or at least ensuring their neutrality. As many tribes weren't centrally unified, it was typical for individual bands to act independently and sometimes join opposing sides contrary to formal agreements.\n\n3.  \nIn the Southeast's interior, tribes such as the Catawba, Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee, all speaking different languages, held significant influence. The French called on their trading partners in the western Great Lakes area—including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi—for assistance in the war, even though these tribes had no direct stake in the Franco-British struggle. The British were backed by the Iroquois Confederacy and, at first, the Cherokee, but tensions led to the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. That year, Pennsylvania's Treaty of Easton persuaded various Ohio Country tribes to remain neutral in return for land and concessions. Most northern tribes allied with the French due to longstanding trading relationships. Both France and Britain tried to sway the Creek and Cherokee through diplomatic efforts to secure their involvement or neutrality. However, as tribal organization was decentralized, small groups often fought contrary to their nation’s official treaties, making tribal loyalty complex and sometimes unpredictable.",

When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict. It was not uncommon for small bands to participate on the \"other side\" of the conflict from formally negotiated agreements, as most tribes were decentralized and bands made their own decisions about warfare.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Both children and older adults have weaker immune responses, with the decline starting around age 50 due to a process called immunosenescence. In wealthier nations, factors like obesity, alcohol abuse, and drug use commonly lead to reduced immune function. By contrast, in less developed countries, malnutrition is the leading cause of immunodeficiency. A lack of adequate protein in the diet impairs important immune activities, including cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte action, IgA antibody production, and cytokine release. Moreover, the early loss of the thymus, whether by genetic defect or surgery, causes severe immunodeficiency and a high risk of infections.\n\n2. The immune system can become deficient if any of its elements stop working. Young children and elderly people are particularly at risk, as immunity begins to weaken from about age 50 due to immunosenescence. In industrialized countries, poor immune health often results from obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, or drug abuse, while malnutrition is the most frequent cause in developing regions. Diets low in protein are linked to decreased cell-mediated defenses, complement proteins, phagocytic performance, IgA antibody levels, and cytokine synthesis. Furthermore, losing the thymus early in life, either genetically or surgically, leads to serious immunodeficiency with a strong predisposition to infections.\n\n3. When certain parts of the immune system are inactive, immunodeficiencies can develop. The immune response is generally weaker in both the very young and the elderly, starting to decline around age 50 due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcoholism, and illicit drug use are major contributors to poor immune health. Conversely, in developing nations, malnutrition remains the primary cause of immunodeficiency. Insufficient dietary protein impairs various immune functions, including those performed by cells, complement system, phagocytes, IgA antibodies, and cytokines. Additionally, if the thymus is lost at an early age because of a genetic issue or surgical removal, it leads to serious immune weakness and increased vulnerability to infections.",

Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them.

One way is through the transfer of IgG antibodies across the placenta during pregnancy, giving the baby a supply of antibodies at birth that mirrors those of the mother. Additionally, antibodies in breast milk or colostrum protect the infant’s gut from bacterial infections until the baby’s own immune system matures. This form of protection is considered passive because the baby does not produce the antibodies or immune memory itself—it simply receives them. Passive immunity is temporary, usually lasting from a few days to a few months. Doctors can also provide passive immunity by giving antibody-rich serum to patients.\n\n2. Infants, who haven’t yet encountered many germs, are especially prone to infections. However, mothers supply layers of passive defense. During pregnancy, IgG antibodies are passed from mother to child via the placenta, so babies are born with a supply of antibodies similar to their mother’s. Breast milk and colostrum also pass antibodies to the baby's digestive system, guarding against harmful bacteria until the child's immune system is ready to take over. Since these antibodies aren’t produced by the child, but rather borrowed, this is called passive immunity, which only lasts for a limited time—from days to months. In healthcare, passive immunity can also be induced by transferring antibody-rich serum from one person to another.\n\n3. Because newborns have not yet been exposed to microorganisms, they are very vulnerable to infections. Mothers help protect their babies by providing passive immunity in several ways. IgG antibodies cross the placenta to the fetus during pregnancy, ensuring that babies are born with high antibody levels matching the mother’s. Additionally, breast milk and colostrum deliver antibodies to the baby's gut, helping prevent bacterial infections until the baby starts making its own antibodies. This type of immunity is called passive since the infant doesn’t create these antibodies or immune cells itself; it only receives them from the mother. Typically, passive immunity is short-lived, lasting only a few days to months. Clinically, passive immunity can also be delivered artificially through antibody-rich serum injections.\n\n4. Since babies haven’t encountered pathogens before birth, they are at greater risk from infections. Mothers provide passive immune protection during pregnancy as IgG antibodies pass through the placenta, equipping infants with the same antibody range as their mothers. The first milk, known as colostrum, and ongoing breast milk also give the baby extra antibodies to protect against bacteria in the digestive tract until the baby can make its own immune responses. This borrowed protection is termed passive immunity, which doesn’t last long—just a few days or months. Additionally, passive immunity can be administered medically by transferring serum containing antibodies between individuals.",

          "text": "1.  \nAccording to Robert J. Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013, the rising gap between the rich and poor in the United States and other places is the biggest challenge today. Growing inequality slows down economic progress. When unemployment is high and lasts a long time, inequality tends to go up, which further hurts economic growth in the long run. Unemployment doesn’t just waste human resources; it also sets off pressures to redistribute wealth, causes economic distortions, forces people into poverty, limits their ability to move for work, and damages self-worth, all of which can lead to social problems and unrest. Therefore, policies that address unemployment and its effects on inequality help promote steady economic growth.\n\n2.  \n2013 Nobel laureate in Economics, Robert J. Shiller, emphasized that increasing inequality is the main issue facing the U.S. and the world. A rise in inequality negatively impacts economic development. Prolonged and widespread unemployment, which typically leads to greater inequality, reduces future economic growth. The adverse effects of unemployment extend beyond wasted potential; it also causes pressure for wealth redistribution and creates economic inefficiencies. Additionally, it pushes individuals into poverty, hinders their ability to move between jobs, and damages their confidence, resulting in social instability and potential conflict. Implementing policies to reduce unemployment and address the negative impacts of inequality can help foster economic growth.\n\n3.  \nNobel Prize-winning economist Robert J. Shiller stated that growing inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere is today’s most serious problem. Rising inequality slows down economic advancement. When unemployment is high and long-lasting, it tends to worsen inequality, which in turn negatively influences long-term economic expansion. Unemployment’s damages go beyond wasted labor—it provokes demands for redistribution and distorts the economy, traps individuals in poverty, restricts their job options, and reduces self-confidence, all of which can lead to social unrest and conflict. Policies aimed at lowering unemployment and especially its inequality-related effects help support the economy’s growth.\n\n4.  \nRobert J. Shiller, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013, argued that the surge in inequality in America and abroad is the most crucial issue we face. Increased inequality stifles economic growth. Persistently high unemployment that causes inequality to rise can weaken long-term economic progress. The negative impact of unemployment isn’t just lost productivity; it also sparks redistribution demands and market distortions, drives poverty, restricts labor flexibility, and harms self-esteem, which can encourage social unrest and conflict. As a result, policies focused on reducing unemployment and its related inequality effects bolster economic growth.",

Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline.\n\n---\n\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, the Mongols strategically appointed Central Asian Muslims as administrators in China and, likewise, assigned Han Chinese and Khitans to govern the Muslim populations in Central Asia, such as in Bukhara. This approach of using outsiders as administrators was intended to weaken the local elites in both regions. The Mongols relocated Han Chinese to Central Asian cities like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand, where they worked as craftsmen and farmers. Military units, including the \"Right Alan Guard,\" were formed from Alans, recently surrendered troops, Mongols, and Chinese, and stationed in places like the former Kingdom of Qocho; in Besh Balikh, a military colony was set up under the Chinese general Qi Kongzhi. After Genghis Khan’s conquest of Central Asia, foreigners were chosen as officials, and the responsibility for tending gardens and fields in Samarqand was shared between Muslims and their Chinese and Qara-Khitay (Khitan) co-managers, as Muslims could not manage them alone. The Mongol governor of Samarqand was a Khitan named Ahai, who held the title of Taishi and was knowledgeable in Chinese culture.\n\n---\n\nThe Mongols, during the Yuan dynasty, introduced Central Asian Muslims as officials in China, and in turn, sent Han Chinese and Khitans to oversee Muslims in cities like Bukhara in Central Asia. This practice of appointing foreigners was meant to dilute the influence of local leaders in both lands. Large numbers of Han Chinese were transferred by the Mongols to Central Asian locations such as Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand, where they served as artisans and agriculturalists. The Mongols also recruited Alans, creating military groups like the \"Right Alan Guard,\" composed of surrendered soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese, with postings in former kingdoms like Qocho. In Besh Balikh, a Chinese general named Qi Kongzhi led a Mongol-established military colony. Following the Mongol conquest, administrative roles were often filled by foreigners, and the management of Samarqand’s fields and gardens was supervised collectively by Muslims and Chinese/Qara-Khitay, as Muslims were forbidden to manage them independently. Ahai, a Khitan familiar with Chinese customs, was appointed governor of Samarqand with the title Taishi.\n\n---\n\nUnder Yuan dynasty rule, the Mongols imported Muslims from Central Asia into China to serve as officials, and likewise dispatched Han Chinese and Khitans from China to administer Muslim communities in Central Asian cities such as Bukhara. By assigning foreigners to administrative positions, the Mongols deliberately reduced the authority of local populations in both areas. Han Chinese populations were relocated to Central Asian centers like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand, where they became artisans and farmers. The Mongols also formed military units from Alans, including the \"Right Alan Guard,\" which combined Alans, surrendered soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese troops in areas like former Qocho. In Besh Balikh, a Chinese-led colony was established under the command of General Qi Kongzhi. After Genghis Khan’s conquests, administrative posts were filled by foreigners, and Muslims in Samarqand were required to jointly manage agricultural works with Chinese and Qara-Khitay (Khitan) counterparts. The appointed Mongol governor of Samarqand was a Khitan named Ahai, known for his familiarity with Chinese culture and his title Taishi.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like more versions or need a summary!",

          "text": "1.  \nA number of theologians, such as Zwingli, Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Johannes Oecolampadius, held different views about the meaning of Jesus’ words at the Last Supper: “This is my body which is for you” and “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Martin Luther stood firm on his belief in the Real Presence, maintaining that Christ’s body and blood were truly present in the bread and wine, a concept he called sacramental union. His opponents argued that God was present only spiritually or symbolically. Zwingli, for instance, rejected the idea that Jesus could exist in more than one place at once, while Luther emphasized the omnipresence of Christ’s human nature. The debate between them often became heated. Quoting John 6:63, “The flesh profiteth nothing,” Zwingli declared, “This passage breaks your neck.” Luther responded, “Don’t be too proud. German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” Throughout, Luther wrote “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) in chalk to reinforce his unwavering position.\n\n2.  \nTheologians like Zwingli, Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Johannes Oecolampadius disagreed about what Jesus meant during the Last Supper when he said, “This is my body which is for you,” and, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Luther asserted that Christ’s body and blood were really present in the bread and wine, a view he termed sacramental union, while others thought God was present only symbolically or spiritually. Zwingli, for example, claimed that Jesus could not be in several places simultaneously, whereas Luther argued that Christ, in his human nature, was omnipresent. Their debate was sometimes contentious. Zwingli said, quoting John 6:63, “This passage breaks your neck,” to which Luther replied, “Don’t be too proud. German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” Luther kept “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) written on the table in chalk as a sign of his unyielding belief.\n\n3.  \nThere was disagreement among theologians such as Zwingli, Melanchthon, Bucer, and Oecolampadius about what Jesus meant at the Last Supper with his words, “This is my body which is for you” and “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Luther passionately defended the belief in the Real Presence, arguing that Christ was truly present in the consecrated bread and wine—a view he called sacramental union. His counterparts saw God as present only in a symbolic or spiritual sense. Zwingli, in particular, objected to the idea that Jesus could be physically present in more than one place at a time, but Luther insisted that Christ’s human nature had omnipresence. The discussions grew heated, with Zwingli once saying, “This passage breaks your neck,” quoting John 6:63. Luther retorted, “Don’t be too proud. German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” He showed his commitment by writing “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) in chalk on the table.",

Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine, which he called the sacramental union, while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present. Zwingli, for example, denied Jesus' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature. According to transcripts, the debate sometimes became confrontational. Citing Jesus' words \"The flesh profiteth nothing\" (John 6.63), Zwingli said, \"This passage breaks your neck\". \"Don't be too proud,\" Luther retorted, \"German necks don't break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.\" On his table Luther wrote the words \"Hoc est corpus meum\" (\"This is my body\") in chalk, to continually indicate his firm stance.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

          "text": "Certainly! Here are several distinct rewrites of the passage, each separated by a newline.\n\nThe history of Earth's geology is illustrated by four timelines. The first timeline covers all the time since the Earth formed, but this makes the most recent eon very small. To address this, the second timeline zooms in on the latest eon, though it compresses its latest era. The third timeline magnifies this most recent era. Because the Quaternary period is very short and consists of brief epochs, the fourth timeline provides a close-up of this period. Each of the second, third, and fourth timelines is a subset of the previous one, as shown by asterisks. The latest epoch, the Holocene, is too brief to display clearly on the third scale, which makes expanding the fourth scale helpful. The Pleistocene is indicated by “P,” and “Q” refers to the Quaternary period.\n\nGeologic time is represented across four increasingly detailed timelines. The first timeline covers all of Earth’s history but condenses recent events. Therefore, a second timeline expands the most recent eon, though it squeezes the latest era. The third timeline enlarges this era, and because the Quaternary period contains very short epochs, it is given its own, fourth, expanded timeline. Each subsequent timeline is a detailed section of the previous one, marked by asterisks. Since the Holocene epoch is so recent, it is not visible on the third timeline, which is why the fourth scale is needed. The abbreviation \"P\" stands for the Pleistocene epoch, while \"Q\" refers to the Quaternary period.\n\nTo illustrate geologic time, four different timelines are used. The first covers Earth’s entire history but compresses recent times. The second timeline zooms in on just the most recent eon, but ends up making the most recent era smaller. The third timeline expands this era, and finally, the fourth zooms in on the brief Quaternary period and its short epochs. Each new timeline is a part of the previous, as shown with asterisks. Because the Holocene epoch is so short, it’s not visible on the third timeline, making the fourth necessary. \"P\" represents the Pleistocene epoch and \"Q\" the Quaternary period.\n\nThe geologic timeline is divided into four successive scales. The first encompasses the full span from Earth’s origin to today, but this leaves the latest eon condensed. So, the second timeline shows just the latest eon at a larger scale, although this compresses its last era. The third timeline focuses on that compressed era, and the fourth zone highlights the rapidly changing epochs of the Quaternary, a very short time frame. Each subsequent timeline is a magnified segment of its predecessor, designated by asterisks. The Holocene, being the newest epoch, is too short to display well on the third timeline, necessitating the expanded fourth scale. \"P\" and \"Q\" stand for the Pleistocene epoch and the Quaternary period, respectively.",

Interestingly, only the chloroplast is retained, not the entire cryptophyte, as the organelle lacks its nucleomorph and has lost its two outermost membranes, resulting in a chloroplast with just two membranes. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts need their nucleomorph for maintenance, and Dinophysis species cannot survive long-term in lab cultures, it is suspected—though not proven—that these are kleptoplasts. This means Dinophysis possibly needs to keep capturing new cryptophytes to continually replace their worn-out chloroplasts.\n\n2.  \nThe genus Dinophysis is notable for harboring chloroplasts with phycobilins that originate from cryptophyte organisms. These chloroplasts are unique as Dinophysis does not retain the entire cryptophyte cell—only the chloroplast, which has been stripped of its nucleomorph and two outer membranes, so only a double-membraned organelle remains. Because cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to function properly, and Dinophysis cannot live indefinitely on their own in cultures, scientists think (though haven’t confirmed) that Dinophysis uses these as kleptoplasts, meaning they must periodically ingest new cryptophytes to replenish aging chloroplasts.\n\n3.  \nIn Dinophysis species, the chloroplasts they use are derived from cryptophytes and contain phycobilins, but only the chloroplast is taken—not the entire cryptophyte cell. These chloroplasts lack a nucleomorph and the outer two membranes, leaving a structure with just two membranes. Since a nucleomorph is necessary for the maintenance of cryptophyte chloroplasts, and Dinophysis cannot survive long in isolation, it suggests (but does not confirm) that these are kleptoplasts. As such, Dinophysis may need to regularly consume cryptophytes to replenish their functional chloroplasts as the old ones degrade.\n\n4.  \nMembers of the Dinophysis genus feature chloroplasts with phycobilins, which they obtain by absorbing chloroplasts from cryptophyte algae, not the whole organism. These stolen chloroplasts have lost their nucleomorph and two outermost membranes, leaving them with only two membranes. Given that cryptophyte chloroplasts cannot sustain themselves without a nucleomorph and Dinophysis cannot be grown indefinitely in culture, it is possible, though yet to be proven, that these chloroplasts are kleptoplasts and must be replaced repeatedly as they fail, requiring Dinophysis to continually consume cryptophytes.",

A similar arrangement exists in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV). Notably, KQTV is based in St. Joseph, Missouri—a city counted as a different market from Kansas City by Nielsen, even though they're less than 55 miles apart. WWSB and WOTV exist to cover areas where the main ABC affiliate’s signal is weak; for instance, WWSB serves the southern Tampa region, including Sarasota, due to past transmitter issues with the former primary affiliate, WTSP, which had to avoid interfering with Miami’s WPLG on the same channel.\n\n2.  \nABC stands out for having independently owned affiliates operating within the same viewing areas in certain places: WFTS-TV and WWSB in Tampa, and WZZM and WOTV in Grand Rapids. Kansas City also sees this unusual situation with KMBC-TV and KQTV. KQTV is officially licensed in St. Joseph, Missouri—a market separate from Kansas City according to Nielsen, though the cities are quite close. WWSB and WOTV fill coverage gaps where their regions don’t get a strong signal from the main network affiliate. In the case of WWSB, it began serving Sarasota and the southern part of Tampa’s market because the original affiliate, WTSP, had transmission constraints tied to frequency conflicts with Miami’s WPLG.\n\n3.  \nThe ABC network features an uncommon setup: some markets are served by more than one affiliate, each under different ownership, such as WFTS-TV and WWSB in Tampa and WZZM and WOTV in Grand Rapids. There's a similar case in the Kansas City area, involving KMBC-TV and KQTV. Although KQTV is located in St. Joseph, Missouri, Nielsen treats it as a separate market from Kansas City, even though they’re only about 55 miles apart. The existence of WWSB and WOTV is partly due to their regions lacking reliable coverage from the markets’ main ABC stations; for example, WWSB addresses gaps in the southern Tampa area, largely because WTSP’s transmitter, the original affiliate, had to avoid interference with Miami’s WPLG on the same VHF channel.\n\nLet me know if you need these passages adjusted for length, formality, or anything else!",

While not very efficient, Newcomen’s engine found its main role in pumping water, especially from deep mines.

It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable \"head\". Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

In 1953, REM sleep was first discovered at the university by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky.\n\n2.  \nImportant scientific and academic breakthroughs have occurred at the University of Chicago. The institution has deeply influenced economic thought through the Chicago school of economics, supported by Milton Friedman. Its sociology department pioneered the discipline independently in the United States, bringing about the Chicago school of sociology. Accomplishments in physics include hosting the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction (Chicago Pile-1), Millikan's experiment that determined the charge of the electron, and Willard F. Libby’s invention of radiocarbon dating in 1947. The university was also where the Miller–Urey experiment on the origins of life and the discovery of REM sleep by Kleitman and Aserinsky took place.\n\n3.  \nThe University of Chicago is notable for ground-breaking research and intellectual innovation. It gave rise to the Chicago school of economics, known for shaping free market ideas, with economists like Milton Friedman at the forefront. The university also established the first independent sociology department in America, sparking the Chicago school of sociology. In scientific research, the university was home to several landmark achievements: the first artificial, self-sustaining nuclear reaction (Chicago Pile-1), Millikan’s landmark calculation of the electron's charge, and Libby's development of radiocarbon dating. The Miller–Urey experiment, replicating Earth’s early conditions to test the origins of life, was performed here, as was the discovery of REM sleep in 1953.",

These rely on random testing; for a composite number, such a test might still pass some of the time. If we repeat the test multiple times and always get a pass, the chance that the number is actually composite shrinks exponentially with each test, making us nearly (but not totally) certain it’s prime. However, if the test fails even once, we know it’s composite.\n\n2.  \nPrimality tests for a number n generally fit into two categories: deterministic algorithms, which offer definite results, and probabilistic algorithms, which are faster but less certain. Deterministic tests, such as trial division, can conclusively determine if a number is prime or composite. Probabilistic tests conduct random checks that are likely (but not guaranteed) to identify non-primes, so repeating the test multiple times can make us increasingly confident that a number is prime, although we can never be completely sure. A single failed test, however, confirms that the number is not prime.\n\n3.  \nTo check if a number is prime, mathematicians use either deterministic or probabilistic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms like trial division provide absolute certainty, always correctly labeling numbers as prime or composite. Probabilistic methods, while faster, only give a probability that a number is prime because they use random elements in testing. If a number passes the probabilistic test repeatedly, our confidence in its primality grows, as the chance of it being composite shrinks rapidly. Still, absolute certainty only comes from deterministic methods, and any failure in the probabilistic test reveals the number is composite.",

His books, translated into many languages, recast Islam for the modern era and inspired a range of Islamist thinkers, from traditional scholars to reformists like al-Faruqi, who continued Maududi’s legacy with his project for the \"Islamization of Knowledge.\"\n\n4.  \nA major force in Islamic revivalism, Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi began his work in early twentieth-century India and continued to shape religious thought in Pakistan after 1947. Although educated as a lawyer, he became widely known for his journalism and his focus on issues of Islamic law. In 1941, he founded Jamaat-e-Islami, leading the party for three decades, but his greatest impact was through his widely translated writings. These works brought Islamic principles into the modern discourse and deeply influenced both traditionalist scholars and innovative Islamists like al-Faruqi, whose vision of the \"Islamization of Knowledge\" built on Maududi’s foundational concepts.",

One way this appears is through the fact that if there were only a limited number of prime numbers, the value of ζ(1) would not diverge, but would instead be finite. Since the harmonic series (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ...) grows without bound, it indicates an infinite supply of primes.

But the Broncos’ defense stopped them at the 26, and kicker Graham Gano missed a 44-yard field goal, hitting the uprights. The Broncos responded as Peyton Manning connected with Emmanuel Sanders for profits of 25 and 22 yards, leading to a 33-yard Brandon McManus field goal and increasing Denver’s lead to 16–7. Carolina again threatened after the kickoff, with Newton finding Corey Brown for a 42-yard gain. However, disaster struck when Newton’s next throw bounced off Ginn’s hands and was picked off by safety T. J. Ward, who then fumbled but saw Danny Trevathan recover to retain possession for Denver.\n\n2.  \nSuper Bowl 50  \nThe Panthers started the second half with momentum, as Newton launched a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr., putting them deep in Broncos territory. Still, Denver’s defense stiffened, and the drive stalled at the 26-yard line, resulting in a missed 44-yard field goal by Graham Gano. Seizing the opportunity, Peyton Manning threw consecutive passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, which set up a 33-yard field goal by Brandon McManus. That kick extended the Broncos' lead to 16–7. Carolina’s next drive opened with a 42-yard completion from Newton to Corey Brown, but another costly mistake followed. Newton’s pass ricocheted off Ginn’s hands and was intercepted by T. J. Ward, who fumbled on the return, but the Broncos’ Trevathan recovered it, keeping the ball for Denver.\n\n3.  \nSuper Bowl 50  \nCarolina came out strong in the second half as Cam Newton threw a 45-yard bomb to Ted Ginn Jr., advancing to the Denver 35. Yet, the Broncos’ defense stood firm, forcing a long field goal that Graham Gano missed off the upright. Peyton Manning then led Denver downfield with two big completions to Emmanuel Sanders, paving the way for a McManus 33-yard field goal and a 16–7 advantage. The Panthers continued to move the ball when Newton hit Corey Brown for 42 yards, but their progress was again undone when a tipped pass bounced off Ginn and landed in the arms of Denver safety T. J. Ward. Though Ward lost the ball on the return, teammate Todd Davis scooped it up, ensuring Denver maintained control.",

This rich and fertile earth enabled both farming and forestry in an area that was once thought to be inhospitable. As a result, much of the Amazon’s landscape may have been shaped over centuries by human activity, not solely by natural forces as long believed. In 2003, Michael Heckenberger and his team from the University of Florida discovered traces of sizable ancient settlements in the Xingu tribal area, including roads, bridges, and large plazas.\n\n2.  \nWidespread throughout the Amazon, terra preta (\"black earth\") is now understood to be the outcome of traditional soil practices by indigenous communities. Its creation made agriculture and forest management possible in a region once considered too challenging for such activities. This suggests that vast parts of the Amazon rainforest could be the legacy of centuries of human influence, contrary to previous beliefs about its untouched nature. In 2003, researchers led by Michael Heckenberger in the Xingu region uncovered remnants of major settlements, such as roads, bridges, and big open plazas.\n\n3.  \nThe \"black earth\" known as terra preta is scattered across large swathes of the Amazon and is currently seen as a testament to indigenous soil engineering. Because this fertile soil supported farming and tree cultivation in otherwise difficult surroundings, it implies that much of the Amazon rainforests landscape was likely shaped by generations of human management rather than being purely natural. Evidence of this, including structures like roads, bridges and significant plazas, was uncovered in 2003 by University of Florida’s Michael Heckenberger and co-researchers in the Xingu area.\n\n4.  \nTerra preta, or black earth, covers extensive areas in the Amazon and is now largely regarded as the product of indigenous management methods. This exceptionally fertile soil facilitated agriculture and tree cultivation where it would not have otherwise thrived, indicating that humans have played a substantial role in shaping the forest. Supporting this idea, Michael Heckenberger and his team found archaeological traces of vast settlements—including roads, bridges, and large communal spaces—among the Xingu people’s territory in 2003.",

          "text": "1. Since about 3000 years ago, human activities began influencing the Rhine delta. With the rise of Bronze Age agriculture and increasing clearing of land in the central German uplands, the Rhine’s sediment load increased, causing the delta to grow faster. This led to more frequent flooding and sediment deposition, which stopped peat formation in the delta. The main way sediment was spread across the delta was through the shifting of river channels, a process called avulsion. Around 80 avulsions have happened in the past 6000 years. Human intervention in the delta started during Roman times with peat mining for salt and fuel. Later, in the 11th to 13th centuries, people built embankments along the main river branches and dammed minor ones. Canal digging, bend cutting, and the construction of groynes followed to keep river channels stable and free from silt.\n\n2. Human influence on the Rhine delta became evident around 3000 years before present, coinciding with Bronze Age land clearing in upland areas of central Germany. This increased erosion and the flow of sediment in the Rhine, accelerating the delta’s expansion. As a result, flooding and sedimentation intensified, halting the growth of peat in the delta. The main process distributing this sediment was avulsion, where river channels frequently changed course across the floodplain. Over the last 6000 years, about 80 such avulsions have shaped the delta. After the Romans began mining peat for salt and fuel, direct human modification of the delta increased. During the 11th to 13th centuries, people built embankments on major channels, dammed minor ones, and soon after, constructed canals, straightened river bends, and added groynes to prevent channel migration and silting.\n\n3. Around 3000 years ago, humans began to significantly affect the Rhine delta. The expansion of Bronze Age farming and land clearance in central Germany led to more sediment being carried by the Rhine, which quickened the delta's growth. Flooding and sedimentation became more frequent, which put an end to peat accumulation in the area. The most important mechanism for spreading sediment in the subrecent delta was avulsion, where the river switched channels across the floodplain. Roughly 80 channel shifts, or avulsions, have been recorded in the past 6000 years. Human activities such as peat mining for salt and fuel started in the Roman era. Later, embankment of main river branches, damming of minor channels, and the creation of canals, cutoff bends, and groynes occurred during the medieval period to manage the river’s movement and prevent silting.",

Education is a subject that both the central and state governments have authority over, as it falls under the Concurrent list in the constitution. Typically, the central government sets broad policies, while state governments establish their own specific rules for running schools.

The authority over schools is shared by both the union and state governments because education is included in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects.
