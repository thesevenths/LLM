          "text": "Certainly! Here’s an explanation and summary of the passage you provided about **European Union law** and the **direct effect of Directives**:\n\n---\n\n### Key Points from the Passage\n\n1. **Direct Effect of EU Laws:**\n   - *Treaties* and *Regulations* can have “direct effect,” which means individuals can rely on them directly in their national courts if they are clear, unconditional, and immediate.\n   - *Directives*, on the other hand, usually do **not** give citizens the right to sue other citizens based solely on the Directive itself (they lack “horizontal” direct effect).\n\n2. **Reason for Distinction:**\n   - According to **Article 288 TFEU**, Directives are addressed to *member states*, not individuals, giving states flexibility in how they implement the goals of the Directive.\n   - Directives often set minimum standards, allowing member states to apply stricter rules if they wish. (e.g., *Working Time Directive* grants 4 weeks paid leave, but national laws often give more.)\n\n3. **Current Legal Position:**\n   - Individuals can make claims **based on national law** that implements a Directive, but not from the Directive itself.\n   - Directives do **not** generally have “horizontal direct effect”—citizens cannot use Directives to sue other private parties.\n\n4. **Controversy:**\n   - In the early 1990s, several senior legal advisors (Advocate Generals) argued that Directives *should* create rights and obligations for all, including between citizens (horizontal effect).\n   - The **Court of Justice** rejected that position, but carved out **five main exceptions** (not listed in your passage).\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| EU Legal Instrument | Direct Effect?       | Horizontal Direct Effect? | Example                                                                                      |\n|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Treaty              | Yes (if clear)      | Yes                      | Individuals can enforce Treaty norms against each other or the state.                         |\n| Regulation          | Yes (if clear)      | Yes                      | Directly applies—e.g. competition law.                                                       |\n| Directive           | Indirect (via state)| No (mostly)—horizontal effect | Worker can sue the state for failing to implement Worker Time Directive, but not another company. |\n\n---\n\n## Important Terms\n\n- **Horizontal effect:** Ability to be enforced between private parties (individuals, companies).\n- **Vertical effect:** Ability to be enforced against the state or state entities.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n- If the Working Time Directive requires 28 days paid holiday:\n  - You cannot sue your employer directly under the Directive unless your state’s law implements it.\n  - You can sue the state if it fails to implement the Directive (vertical effect).\n  - Some exceptions apply (not detailed in your passage).\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n*Directives set goals for member states and are usually only directly enforceable against the state, not other citizens or private entities — but the legal rule has exceptions.*\n\nIf you want details on the *five exceptions*, let me know!",

He united various warring tribes, creating a unified Mongol political and ethnic identity. Genghis Khan reinforced traditional Mongol customs and introduced innovations, such as the traditional Mongolian script and the first written law, the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration). The Ikh Zasag included strict anti-corruption laws, and modern Mongolian leaders, including President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, view Genghis Khan as a model for rule of law and anti-corruption. According to Elbegdorj, Genghis Khan believed in equality under the law and in the longevity of good laws over material achievements. Mongolians regard Genghis Khan as the founder of the Mongol Empire and the basis for modern Mongolia.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Unification:** Genghis Khan unified Mongol tribes that previously lacked a single identity.\n2. **Tradition & Stability:** He reinforced traditions and brought stability during times of conflict.\n3. **Innovations:** He introduced the Mongolian script and the first written law code (Ikh Zasag).\n4. **Legal Reforms:** The Ikh Zasag punished corruption and bribery harshly, emphasizing equality before the law.\n5. **Modern Relevance:** Mongolian leaders view Genghis Khan’s emphasis on law and justice as relevant to contemporary anti-corruption efforts.\n6. **Legacy:** Mongolians see him as the founder of both the Mongol Empire and the nation of Mongolia.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe passage highlights Genghis Khan’s lasting legacy in Mongolian culture and governance. Through legal and social reform, he laid the groundwork for both a unified Mongol nation and ongoing efforts toward justice and anti-corruption. The excerpt from President Elbegdorj’s speech connects Genghis Khan’s principles to present-day ideals, showing the continued cultural and political impact of his leadership.\n\nIf you have follow-up questions or need more focused information (for example, on his legal reforms), let me know!",

He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.\n\n"

Although the structure and terminology of the government seemed heavily Chinese, its actual operation integrated multiple ethnic and cultural features. Chinese advisers were influential in shaping the early Yuan court, and the central government was organized early in Kublai Khan’s rule using traditional Chinese administrative models, specifically dividing authority between civil, military, and censorial branches. However, civil and military functions often overlapped due to Mongol customs. A civilian bureaucracy, topped by the Central Secretariat, coordinated most governmental agencies (including the traditional Six Ministries), though there were occasional experiments with institutions focused on finance like the Department of State Affairs, which were usually temporary.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Multi-Cultural Bureaucracy**: Yuan bureaucracy incorporated Han Chinese, Khitan, Jurchen, Mongol, and Tibetan Buddhist influences.\n\n2. **Chinese Influence**: \n   - Government structure and terminology were primarily based on earlier Chinese dynasties (Tang, Song, Liao, Jin).\n   - Influential Chinese advisers, such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu, helped form the early court structure.\n\n3. **Organizational Structure**:\n   - Adopted a Chinese-style division: \n     - **Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng):** Managed civil affairs.\n     - **Privy Council (樞密院):** Managed military affairs.\n     - **Censorate:** Responsible for surveillance and inspection.\n\n4. **Civil-Military Overlap**: Despite adopting Chinese models, Yuan governance had significant overlap between civil and military authorities due to Mongol traditions.\n\n5. **Central Secretariat’s Role**: Served as the top institution, overseeing most government ministries.\n\n6. **Department of State Affairs**: Occasionally established to handle finance, but these efforts were usually short-lived.\n\n---\n\n**If you need:**\n- **A comparison with other dynasties**\n- **Analysis of Mongol vs. Chinese traditions**\n- **Implications for Yuan rule**\n- **Short-answer questions**  \nLet me know!",

They only change how individual parts move relative to each other.\n- **External Force:**  \n  If there *is* an external force, the *center of mass* of the system will accelerate according to Newton's Second Law:\n  \\[\n  a_{cm} = \\frac{F_{ext}}{M}\n  \\]\n  where:\n  - \\( a_{cm} \\) = acceleration of the center of mass,\n  - \\( F_{ext} \\) = external force on the system,\n  - \\( M \\) = total mass of the system.\n\n### Key Concept:\n- **Internal vs. External Forces:**  \n  Internal forces never change the motion of the center of mass of a closed system. Only external forces do that.\n\n#### Example:\nImagine two people on ice skates pushing off each other. They move apart, but the center of mass of the two-person system doesn't accelerate unless something from outside (like someone pushing one of them) applies a force.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details, an example, or a diagram!",

The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.

Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]",

      "prompt": "Passage:\nHuguenot\nA term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]\n\n"

He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life. Others had translated the Bible into German, but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine. When he was criticised for inserting the word \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, he replied in part: \"[T]he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it. For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine, namely, that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law. ... But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say, 'Faith alone justifies us, and not works'.\"\n\n"

For example, some problems that are fast on one model may be slower on another. However, according to the **Cobham-Edmonds thesis**, as long as we allow for polynomial differences in running time, all \"reasonable\" models are about equally powerful, up to a polynomial (i.e., not exponential) factor. This is the basis for the **complexity class P**—the set of problems solvable in polynomial time on a deterministic Turing machine. For function problems, the corresponding class is called **FP**.\n\n---\n\n### Key Points Explained\n\n- **Computation models matter:** How much time a problem takes to solve can depend on the type of Turing machine or computing device you're using.\n- **Polynomial time as a standard:** If you only care about computations that can be done in polynomial time, different \"reasonable\" models of computation can be compared fairly—differences will only be polynomial, not exponential.\n- **Class P:** Problems that can be solved (yes/no answer) in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine.\n- **Class FP:** Function problems (where the output is a value, not just yes/no) that can be computed in polynomial time.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like a more detailed explanation, or examples for the classes P and FP, feel free to ask!",

Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God.

Here’s a summary and analysis of your provided passage about Martin Luther:\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhen Martin Luther entered university, he initially studied law as his father wished but soon abandoned it, finding law unsatisfying and uncertain. Luther was instead attracted to theology and philosophy, with a focus on thinkers like Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. Influenced by tutors Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, Luther learned to critically evaluate all ideas through personal experience. However, he found philosophy inadequate because it relied on reason rather than offering a way to love God, which he considered more important. Luther decided that reason was useful for questioning people and institutions but not for understanding God. He believed that knowledge of God came only through divine revelation, making Scripture central to his faith.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points/Analysis:**\n\n- **Disillusionment with Law:** Luther left law school quickly because he found its principles uncertain and unfulfilling.\n- **Shift to Theology and Philosophy:** He sought answers about life’s assurances by turning to theology and studying important philosophers, especially Aristotle.\n- **Influence of Tutors:** Two major tutors taught Luther to be skeptical and rely on his own experience.\n- **Limitations of Philosophy:** Luther thought philosophy could use reason to explain things but couldn't teach one how to truly love God.\n- **Critique of Reason:** He developed a complex view of reason—valuable for questioning human systems, but insufficient for understanding divinity.\n- **Emphasis on Revelation and Scripture:** Luther concluded that one could comprehend God only through divine revelation, making the Bible increasingly significant in his thought.\n\n---\n\n**If you have specific questions or need a more detailed analysis, let me know!**",

Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.\n\n"

This change meant they had to cancel Apollo 20. As NASA’s budget shrank after the Moon landing and resources were shifted to develop the Space Shuttle, missions 18 and 19 were also canceled by 1971. The leftover Saturn V rockets were put on display at various museums and space centers.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Plans changed after Apollo 11 due to budget concerns and new priorities.\n- Using Saturn V for Skylab instead of Apollo 20.\n- Apollo 18, 19, and 20 were canceled—the last three lunar missions never happened.\n- Surplus Saturn V rockets became museum pieces at several US locations:\n   - Kennedy Space Center (Florida)\n   - Marshall Space Center (Alabama)\n   - Michoud Assembly Facility (Louisiana)\n   - Johnson Space Center (Texas)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need this in a different format!",

Here’s a summary and explanation of the passage:\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe passage discusses how the immune system behaves differently during sleep and wake periods. When a person is awake, certain immune cells (like cytotoxic natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes) are most active to defend the body from harmful pathogens. At the same time, anti-inflammatory molecules (like cortisol and catecholamines) also reach their highest levels during wakefulness.\n\nThere are two main theories about why **pro-inflammatory states** are mostly limited to sleep:\n1. **Cognitive & Physical Effects**: If inflammation happened during the day, it could impair the brain and body, interfering with daily function.\n2. **Role of Melatonin**: Inflammation creates oxidative stress, but at night, the hormone melatonin (present during sleep) may help counteract this stress by neutralizing free radicals.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points Explained**\n- **Daytime (Wakefulness):**\n  - Immune defense cells reach peak activity for protection.\n  - Anti-inflammatory hormones also peak, likely to prevent excessive inflammation that could disrupt normal functioning.\n\n- **Nighttime (Sleep):**\n  - The body favors a pro-inflammatory state.\n  - Melatonin is present at higher levels, reducing the harm from inflammation-related oxidative stress.\n  - This is possibly because sleep provides a “safe” period to carry out inflammatory responses when cognitive and physical demands on the body are lowest.\n\n---\n\n**Why does this matter?**\nUnderstanding how the immune system’s activity changes between sleep and wake states helps explain why sleep is important for both healing and fighting infection, and why lack of sleep can increase susceptibility to illness.\n\nIf you want to know more or need the passage rewritten, let me know!",

This ease of transportation made the location more attractive to potential residents.\n\n5. **Annexation to the City:** The tract’s annexation to Fresno in 1912 meant city services could be extended to the area, further supporting development.\n\n6. **Initial Landscaping:** Even before building homes, the tract was landscaped, which increased its appeal, though initially the trees had to be watered by tank wagon.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe combined effects of professional planning, municipal improvements, aggressive marketing, transportation access, and annexation led to a boom in home construction—267 homes in about five years.",

Between 1947 and 1967, oil prices in dollars increased very slowly, under two percent per year, and remained stable versus other currencies and commodities.

In the 9th, it formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia, but in the 10th century, it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire, flowing through Swabia, Franconia and Lower Lorraine. The mouths of the Rhine, in the county of Holland, fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states. The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years' War. The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route.\n\n"

Numerous studies indicate that violence and murder rates are higher in societies with greater income disparities. Research comparing both countries and regions within countries (like U.S. states and Canadian provinces) consistently finds that higher inequality correlates with higher homicide rates. Specifically, Daly et al. (2001) found a tenfold variation in homicide rates tied to inequality, estimating that about half the variation in murder rates could be explained by income differences. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) confirmed this pattern globally. The academic literature broadly supports the link between inequality and increased violence.\n\n### Main Points:\n- **Crime rates, especially homicides, are closely correlated with economic inequality.**\n- **Over fifty studies support the finding that greater income gaps lead to more violence.**\n- **Daly et al. (2001):** In U.S. states and Canadian provinces, homicide rates can differ by a factor of ten due to inequality; about 50% of the variation is explained by income disparity.\n- **Fajnzylber et al.

These policies, coupled with increasing persecution and corruption, led to significant Muslim involvement in rebellions against the Mongols. Notably, Muslim generals like Lan Yu and Feng Sheng fought alongside the Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang to help overthrow the Yuan. Some Hui Muslims today believe their Chinese surname, meaning \"barracks\" or \"thanks,\" came as a token of appreciation for their role in the Mongol downfall. Earlier attempts at rebellion, such as the Ispah Rebellion, were brutally suppressed.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Discrimination under the Yuan:**\n   - High-ranking Muslims faced severe restrictions.\n   - Bans on halal/kosher slaughter and circumcision, forcing adherence to Mongol food customs.\n\n2. **Rebellion & Downfall of the Yuan:**\n   - Persecution led Muslim generals to join Han Chinese in revolt.\n   - Ming Dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu and Feng Sheng who helped overthrow the Yuan.\n\n3. **Legacies:**\n   - Some Muslim communities adopted Chinese surnames interpreted as \"barracks\" or \"thanks\" — believed to honor their role in defeating the Mongols.\n\n4. **Suppressed Uprisings:**\n   - The Ispah Rebellion by the Muslims in the semu class was crushed, resulting in massacres by loyalist commander Chen Youding.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like a paraphrase, analysis, or answers to specific questions!",

      "context": "While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

Over time, it gained more influence:\n     - **Elections since 1979**.\n     - Gradually gained more legislative powers (but still not full rights).\n   - **European Citizens** have limited ways to participate:\n     - May **petition Parliament** or propose an initiative (if backed by 1 million signatures, the Commission must consider it).\n     - Elections for **Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)** held every 5 years, using proportional or single transferable voting systems.\n     - MEPs are allocated **\"degressively proportionally\"**—smaller states get more MEPs per capita than larger states.\n\n4. **MEPs and Political Parties**:\n   - MEPs are grouped by political parties, similar to national parliaments (European People’s Party is the largest; Party of European Socialists is the main opposition).\n   - EU political parties **do not receive EU public funds**—this is managed by member states, per a court ruling.\n\n5. **Parliament’s Powers**:\n   - Can investigate maladministration.\n   - Appoint an Ombudsman.\n   - Demand answers from the Commission.\n   - **Dismiss the Commission** (as happened in 1999 with the Santer Commission) with a two-thirds majority.\n   - Has consultation rights in some legislative areas, but **cannot legislate independently** without approval from both the Commission and Council.\n\n6. **Conclusion on Democratic Nature**:\n   - Ultimate legislative (\"kratia\") power in the EU **does not lie fully with directly elected representatives** (\"demos\"), since both the Commission and Council play dominant roles.  \n   - Thus, **the EU apparatus is not yet as democratically accountable** as the member-states’ own governments.\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation in Simple Terms:**\n\n- The **EU’s law-making process is less democratic** than national governments because the only body directly elected by citizens (the Parliament) cannot start laws by itself and is disadvantaged by voting system biases favoring small countries.\n- The **European Commission** (not directly elected) has more control than Parliament. The **Council** (government ministers from each country) also has significant power.\n- Although **things are improving** (Parliament has more powers now than in the past), citizens still have **fewer rights to shape EU laws** compared to their national governments.\n- The EU system is slowly getting more democratic, but **real power is still not fully in the hands of the citizens’ representatives**.\n\n---\n\nIf you have follow-up questions or need clarification on any point, just let me know!",

      "prompt": "Passage:\nEuropean Union law\nWhile the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"\n\n"

      "context": "The chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on.

Examples from every factory are represented, the collections of Chelsea porcelain and Worcester Porcelain being especially fine. All the major 19th-century British factories are also represented. A major boost to the collections was the Salting Bequest made in 1909, which enriched the museum's stock of Chinese and Japanese ceramics.

Here’s a summary and analysis of the passage:\n\n**Summary:**\nThe passage discusses the American Broadcasting Company's (ABC) efforts at international expansion, specifically highlighting two periods:\n\n1. In the 1990s, the global expansion was tied to the growth of the ESPN network and the policies of Disney Media Networks in the 2000s. This included the expansion of several cable channels such as Disney Channel, Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix, but also the sale of Disney’s 33% stake in the European sports channel Eurosport in 2000.\n\n2. ABC, unlike Disney’s other channels, is broadcast only within the United States, although its programs are syndicated globally. Efforts to launch wholly-owned international ABC networks resurfaced in 2004, with the launch of ABC1 in the UK. However, ABC1 did not achieve sustainable viewership, and Disney discontinued the channel in 2007, ending its attempts to develop ABC International.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points:**\n- 1990s: ESPN’s global growth.\n- 2000s: Expansion of U.S.-based Disney cable channels abroad, and the sale of Eurosport.\n- ABC: Remained U.S.-focused, with international syndication.\n- 2004: ABC1 launched in the UK.\n- 2007: ABC1 closed due to low viewership; ABC International expansion ceased.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage illustrates the challenges ABC faced in establishing a direct international presence. While Disney’s other media properties enjoyed international growth, ABC struggled to compete, particularly highlighted by the failed ABC1 venture in the UK. This demonstrates the difficulties even well-established U.S. networks may face in attracting sustainable audiences abroad, leading to a reliance on syndication rather than direct broadcasting.\n\n---\n\nIf you need answers to specific questions from this passage or a more focused summary, please let me know!",

Base Titanium, a subsidiary of Base resources of Australia, shipped its first major consignment of minerals to China. About 25,000 tonnes of ilmenite was flagged off the Kenyan coastal town of Kilifi. The first shipment was expected to earn Kenya about Shs15 – Shs20 Billion in earnings.

In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

The British also negotiated with other tribes; for example, the Treaty of Easton in 1758 led some Ohio Country tribes to agree to neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other benefits.\n\n3. **Location and Regional Loyalty:** Tribes from the western Great Lakes region were recruited by the French, even though they were from areas not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British.\n\n4. **Decentralization of Tribal Authority:** Most tribes were decentralized, and bands within a tribe made their own decisions about warfare. This meant that some small groups or bands might participate on the \"other side\" of the conflict regardless of formal agreements made by tribal leaders.\n\n5. **Primary Trading Partnerships:** The passage notes that most northern tribes sided with the French because the French were their main trading partner and supplied them with arms.\n\n6. **Diplomatic Efforts:** Both the French and British made efforts to gain either the support or neutrality of powerful southeastern tribes like the Creek and Cherokee.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe tribes’ choices were influenced by their trading partnerships, diplomatic negotiations, the decentralization of tribal decision-making, and efforts by both the French and British to sway them. Many sided with the trading partner who supplied them with weapons and goods, while others acted independently or negotiated for land or neutrality.",

Preventable diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition are the biggest burden, major child-killers, and responsible for much morbidity; weak policies, corruption, inadequate health workers, weak management and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame. According to 2009 estimates, HIV prevalence is about 6.3% of the adult population. However, the 2011 UNAIDS Report suggests that the HIV epidemic may be improving in Kenya, as HIV prevalence is declining among young people (ages 15–24) and pregnant women. Kenya had an estimated 15 million cases of malaria in 2006.\n\n"

Han Chinese communities were established in places such as Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand, where they worked as artisans and farmers. The Mongols also formed military units composed of various nationalities, such as the \"Right Alan Guard,\" which included Alans, Mongol soldiers, surrendered soldiers, and Chinese, particularly stationed in previously Uyghur areas. A Chinese military colony was even established in Besh Balikh under General Qi Kongzhi. In Samarqand, administration and agricultural management were required to involve both Muslims and foreigners (Chinese and Khitans), with Muslims prohibited from managing independently. At one point, the Mongol-appointed governor of Samarqand was a Khitan named Ahai, who was knowledgeable in Chinese culture and held the title Taishi.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need a more concise version, further breakdown, or have specific questions!",

These chloroplasts contain phycobilins, but *Dinophysis* does not keep the cryptophyte as a whole endosymbiont—it only takes the chloroplast. The acquired chloroplast loses both its nucleomorph and the two outermost membranes, resulting in just a two-membrane-bound chloroplast. Normally, cryptophyte chloroplasts need their nucleomorph to stay functional. *Dinophysis* cannot survive alone in culture, so it's possible (but not proven) that these are kleptoplasts: organelles that are temporarily 'stolen' from prey. If true, *Dinophysis* must keep consuming cryptophytes to replenish these worn-out chloroplasts.**\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Chloroplast Origin:** *Dinophysis* gets its chloroplasts from cryptophyte algae.\n- **Type of Chloroplast:** Contains phycobilins, but lacks the cryptophyte’s nucleomorph and outer membranes—leaving just two membranes.\n- **Endosymbiosis:** Only the chloroplast is taken, not the whole cryptophyte cell (not a full endosymbiotic relationship).\n- **Dependence:** Cryptophyte chloroplasts require the nucleomorph for maintenance.\n- **Survival:** *Dinophysis* cannot survive alone in culture; may need fresh chloroplasts regularly.\n- **Kleptoplasty:** The passage suggests *Dinophysis* may practice kleptoplasty (stealing and temporarily using chloroplasts from prey).\n- **Replacement:** If the chloroplasts are kleptoplasts, *Dinophysis* must continuously eat cryptophytes to replace worn-out chloroplasts.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like quiz questions, diagrams, or further explanation about any part of the passage, let me know!",

Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana. The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.\n\n"

Here’s a **summary and explanation** of the passage you provided:\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) has a unique situation in a few U.S. markets where more than one station in the same area operates as an ABC affiliate, each owned and operated separately. Specifically:\n- **Tampa, Florida:** WFTS-TV and WWSB\n- **Grand Rapids, Michigan:** WZZM and WOTV\n- **Kansas City, Missouri:** KMBC-TV and KQTV\n\nHowever, the cases vary. For instance, KQTV is technically not in the Kansas City market but in St. Joseph (a nearby, separately rated TV market). In other cases, extra affiliates like WWSB (Sarasota, FL) and WOTV serve regions within the main TV market that otherwise get a weak or no signal from the primary ABC affiliate (like WTSP in Tampa’s case before 1994). This was sometimes due to technical limitations, such as keeping TV signals from causing interference between cities.\n\n---\n\n**Key Details Explained:**\n\n- **Affiliates:** Local TV stations that broadcast national ABC content.\n- **Separately owned and operated:** These affiliates are not all owned by ABC or each other, but are independent companies licensed by the FCC to broadcast ABC’s programming.\n- **Market:** A region defined by Nielsen (for TV ratings) where stations compete for viewers.\n- **Signal coverage:** Sometimes, the main affiliate can’t reach all parts of a large market or must limit its broadcast reach to avoid interference with other stations. This was a problem for ABC in places like Sarasota, so they needed another local affiliate (like WWSB) to fill the gap.\n- **Historical context:** The issue with WTSP (Tampa’s main ABC affiliate until 1994) is that it shared the same broadcast channel as WPLG in Miami, and their transmitters had to be carefully placed to avoid causing signal problems for each other.\n\n---\n\n**In Short:**\nABC sometimes needs two separate affiliates in the same region so that all viewers can reliably watch its programming—often because of technical or regulatory reasons related to broadcast signals and market boundaries.",

Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n\n"

This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.",

Here’s a summary and key points from the passage about the **Rhine delta**:\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nOver the past 3000 years, human activities have significantly altered the Rhine river delta. Initially, increased land clearing for agriculture in the central German uplands greatly amplified the amount of sediment the river carried. This led to the faster growth of the delta and frequent flooding, which stopped peat formation. The river regularly changed its course (a process known as **avulsion**), distributing sediment across the delta. From Roman times, humans directly modified the delta through peat mining. Then, between the 11th and 13th centuries AD, major river channels were embanked and minor ones dammed. In later centuries, further engineering—like digging canals, straightening bends, and building groynes—was aimed at controlling the river’s path and preventing silting.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **~3000 years BP:** Human impact in the delta begins.\n- **Bronze Age agriculture:** Increases sediment load; delta grows faster.\n- **Flooding & sedimentation:** Increases, peat formation ends.\n- **Avulsion:** Main process distributing sediment; ~80 avulsions in 6000 years.\n- **Roman times:** Peat mining begins for salt and fuel.\n- **11–13th centuries AD:** Embankments of major channels; minor channels dammed.\n- **Later engineering:** Canals, cut-offs, and groynes to stabilize river courses and prevent silting.\n\n---\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Avulsion:** The rapid abandonment of a river channel and the formation of a new river channel.\n- **Distributaries:** Branches of a river that flow away from the main stream, common in deltas.\n- **Embankment:** Construction of walls or levees along a river to prevent flooding.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need this rewritten in essay form, bullet points, or have any specific questions about the passage!",

As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.\n\n"
