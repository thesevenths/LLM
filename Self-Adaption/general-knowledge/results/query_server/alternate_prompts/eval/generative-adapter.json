He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.\n\nImplications:\n"

By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime. Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime. By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a \"unit\".\n\nImplications:\n"

This indicates the V&A is a renowned and globally respected cultural landmark in its field.\n\n2. Founded in 1852 by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the V&A has a rich history that places it among the oldest and most historic museums in the world. Its founding by a monarch and a royal figure speaks to the institution's prestigious and prestigious origins.\n\n3. The V&A is based in the Brompton area of London, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The area is often referred to as \"Albertopolis\" in honour of Prince Albert, who was closely associated with many significant institutions in the district, including the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, and the Royal Albert Hall. This suggests the V&A is part of a larger concentration of cultural and scientific institutions in the area.\n\n4. The museum is an independent body, sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This implies the V&A has a high level of autonomy in its operations and governance, yet it still operates within the broader framework of the UK's cultural and governmental structures.\n\n5. Since its establishment in 2001, the V&A has been free to enter for all. This decision by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made the V&A accessible to all members of society, regardless of their ability to pay, which implies a strong commitment to universal accessibility and the public enjoyment of culture.\n\n6. The V&A's collection spans a broad array of decorative arts and design objects from around the world and across time. This indicates the museum's mission is to be encyclopedic in its scope, representing as many diverse styles, periods, and cultures as possible within its vast collection.\n\n7. As a national institution, the V&A's work likely carries a significant responsibility to preserve, exhibit, and research objects of cultural and historical significance. The museum serves both as an educational and inspirational resource for the public.\n\n8. The V&A's presence in central London allows for easy public access and contributes to the city's cultural vibrancy and reputation as a global hub for art, history, and culture. This suggests the museum contributes to the city's tourist industry and cultural identity. \n\n9. Given its large size and free access, the V&A is a popular destination for both locals and international tourists. This high level of footfall implies a significant economic importance to the area, especially as a contributor to the local tourism industry.\n\n10. Finally, as a public institution, the V&A likely influences public perception and understanding of decorative arts and design. Its exhibitions, research, and public programs likely shape how people appreciate and comprehend these disciplines.",

The Huguenots were drawn towards the Dutch Republic as an attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes due to its Calvinist values and financial wealth.\n3. French-speaking Calvinist churches were also established in the Dutch Republic as a result of the Huguenot community.\n4. The Netherlands became a hub for Huguenots seeking a safe haven and to practice their religion after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\n5. The Dutch Republic's position as a strong opponent of Louis XIV and his policies, as well as its tolerance of religious diversity, attracted many foreign religious minorities seeking refuge, such as the Huguenots.\n6. The Huguenots, being Calvinist, found a favorable environment in the Netherlands where they could practice their religion without persecution.\n7. William III of Orange, who later became King of England, played a crucial role in defending the Netherlands against Louis XIV's aggression and in creating a safer environment for Huguenots to settle in the country.\n8. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes had significant effects on the religious and political dynamics of Europe during the time period, causing political strife and forcing religious minorities to seek refuge.\n9. The Dutch Republic, with its strong Calvinist values and financial power, emerged as a major player in the European political landscape during this time.\n10.

The Philo Greco-Roman Club, to which some members of the \"synagogue of the Tyrians\" belonged, met in a building in the Byzantine neighborhood of Neorion, and hosted many of the state's leaders in 1476. All this brought the Sephardic community into contact with elite members of the Christian minority in Rhodes, at a time when the republic was undergoing a traumatic experience—its final confrontation with Venice.\n\nImplications:\n1. The presence of prominent Jews such as Meir Caro and Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno in Rhodes allowed the Smiths, who were part of the \"synagogue of the Tyrians,\" to meet and interact with notable members of the Jewish community.\n2. The Philo Greco-Roman Club, which the Smiths joined, was attended by leaders of the Christian community, and served as a platform for networking and forming connections between various groups in Rhodes.\n3. The fact that the Philo Greco-Roman Club was located in the Byzantine neighborhood of Neorion suggests that the city had a mix of different cultural and religious influences, providing opportunities for integration and interaction among its diverse populations.\n4. The importance of the Philo Greco-Roman Club as a center for leaders of the state implies that it had a significant role in politics and governance during the time, as it hosted many prominent figures.\n5. The encounter between the Sephardic community and elite members of the Christian minority in Rhodes reflects the complex interplay of different religious and cultural groups within the broader society of Rhodes.\n6. The meeting of the Smiths with influential figures from the Jewish community and the Philo Greco-Roman Club highlights the dynamic and interconnected nature of the social network in Rhodes, where people from different backgrounds came together for discussion and interaction.\n7. The final confrontation with Venice, as a traumatic event for Rhodes, may have further impacted the relationships and alliances among the different groups, possibly leading to a restructuring of the social and political landscape.\n8. The association of the Smiths with the \"synagogue of the Tyrians\" demonstrates the presence of a significant Jewish population in Rhodes during the time period, suggesting a thriving Jewish community.\n9. The involvement of the Sephardic community with influential members of the Christian minority may have led to mutual understanding and respect, as well as an exchange of ideas and knowledge between the two groups.\n10. The experience of the Smiths attending the meetings of the Philo Greco-Roman Club and hosting leaders from various groups in Rhodes provides insights into the social interactions and cultural exchanges that took place during this period, shedding light on the diversity of the city.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nAlso, a virtual reality apparatus allows visitors to take a brief visual tour of what space might look like from another planet. Computer and holography technicians program all the scenes and effects. It seems that the impact of the programmed experience is increased by the knowledge that it is real, not a fake, and will stand up to examination. Reality is almost meaningless for visitors who have been inside it: after walking through the installation, trying on the helmet and gloves, putting on the space suits, the visitors can run around on the surfaces of a planet without any real effort on their part, since they are suspended a few feet off the floor. The computer can put out a rainbow of color if one enters a four-dimensional space, and magnify a particular area so it becomes a strong hologram to photograph.\n\nImplications:\n1. The virtual reality apparatus at the space exhibit creates a convincing and interactive experience for visitors, allowing them to visualize space and simulate the experience of exploring other planets.\n2. The computer and holography technicians involved in programming the scenes and effects ensure that the virtual reality environment is realistic and will withstand examination.\n3. The perceived authenticity and realism of the virtual reality experience increases the impact it has on visitors.\n4. Visitors to the space exhibit can immerse themselves in a simulated environment where they can explore different planets and experience the sensation of walking in space.\n5. The virtual reality helmet and gloves provide an immersive and interactive experience for the visitors, allowing them to feel like they are physically present in a space environment.\n6. The suspended surface on which visitors can run around on adds to the feeling of weightlessness and enhances the immersive experience.\n7. The computer technology can create dynamic and changing environments, including the ability to explore four-dimensional spaces and produce strong holograms to photograph.\n8. The exhibit offers a unique opportunity for visitors to learn and experience aspects of space exploration that are otherwise impossible in a real-world setting.\n9. The virtual reality apparatus enables visitors to explore a variety of environments and scenarios within space, providing a comprehensive understanding of the space environment.\n10. The exhibit demonstrates the power of technology in creating realistic and impactful experiences, transforming traditional learning into an immersive and engaging activity.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nThe preceding images are meant as intuitive introductions to the three-dimensional space we know. Of course, with the modern advent of space travel, these two-dimensional images of Earth are becoming much less useful. As Huygens confirmed in the seventeenth century, the Earth is not flat but spherical. It is easy for us to comprehend this – by travelling on planes. But even so, the traveller can still only experience the world from two dimensions. To really experience three dimensions, you have to live within the space itself. You have to become familiar with the beauty, randomness and strangeness of that space – as New Brunswickers have been.\n\nImplications:\n1. The development of space travel and the modern ability to physically explore space has made it increasingly important to understand three-dimensional space beyond the two-dimensional images we commonly see.\n2. The Earth's spherical shape has been confirmed through space travel, specifically by missions such as the Huygens mission in the seventeenth century.\n3. Despite the possibility to experience the Earth from the perspective of three dimensions, individuals can still only experience it from a two-dimensional perspective, primarily through virtual and imaging technologies.\n4. In order to truly understand and appreciate the complexity and uniqueness of three-dimensional space, individuals must immerse themselves within it and live in that environment.\n5. The ability to become familiar with the beauty, randomness, and strangeness of three-dimensional space, as experienced by New Brunswickers, highlights the importance of direct exposure and exploration.\n6. The realization of the Earth's three-dimensional nature emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world in which we live.\n7. The growing importance of three-dimensional space in our lives underscores the need for ongoing advancements in technology, exploration, and education to further our comprehension of this complex and fascinating space.\n8. The comprehension of three-dimensional space goes beyond merely understanding it intellectually; it involves a sense of personal connection and experience to truly appreciate its intricacies.\n9. The recognition of the Earth's spherical shape and its influence on our perspective of space underscores the importance of constantly revising and expanding our understanding of the world around us.\n10. The exploration of three-dimensional space, both physically and intellectually, plays a crucial role in shaping our collective knowledge and perspective on the universe, helping us comprehend and appreciate its intricacies and mysteries.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nWe would like to encourage the amendment of the law to allow the aboriginal nations more self-determination, including the ability to exercise responsibilities over the lands in the Arctic governed by the current Royal Canadian Geographical Society map of Canada.

In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Together with Coke, Wesley sent a revision of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism.\n\nImplications:\n"

          "text": "1. Chairman Joe Barton's demand for records from Mann, Bradley, and Hughes raises concerns about the motive behind the request and the potential intimidation of scientists.\n\n2. The involvement of Rep. Joe Barton and Ed Whitfield, both with regulatory oversight in climate research, indicates that their actions are politically motivated.\n\n3. Sherwood Boehlert's criticism of Barton's investigation and his suggestion that it could be part of a larger pattern of intimidation for scientists, suggests that there may be a broader trend of attempts to undermine climate research.\n\n4. The request for personal information about the scientists' finances and careers might be seen as an attempt to discredit them or shift focus from the science to their personal lives.\n\n5. The National Academy of Sciences' decision to set up a special investigation to examine the claims made by Barton indicates that the request for records was considered important and significant.\n\n6. The National Research Council's report supporting the basic accuracy of Mann, Bradley, and Hughes' research suggests that there might be limited consensus among scientists on climate change topics.\n\n7. Mann, Bradley, and Hughes' letter to Nature following the Barton investigation shows that they view their work as ongoing and suggesting the need for more research to improve their conclusions.\n\n8. The statement from the National Research Council confirms that there were some statistical issues in the original article, but that they did not significantly alter the data or conclusions presented.\n\n9. Mann, Bradley, and Hughes' continued research into climate change acknowledges the importance of the subject and the ongoing nature of scientific inquiry.\n\n10. The motives behind the Barton investigation remain unclear and may suggest a larger, political agenda.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nMann was honored on March 19, 2008, at the second annual Science & Public Policy Award of the Science & Public Policy Institute, a conservative think tank based in Maryland. This award went to him for his role in compiling the Mann, Bradley, and Hughes 1998 chart, which the Institute claims \"confirmed that global warming is occurring, but more importantly disproved the idea that this problem was unprecedented, showing a notable global temperature spike in the 20th century.\" Opponents of this idea have expressed deep concern about the end of the Little Ice Age causing a rapid increase in global temperatures, and this award is seen as directly counter to such opinions.\n\nImplications:\n\n1. The award from the Science & Public Policy Institute represents recognition for Mann's work in compiling the Mann, Bradley, and Hughes 1998 chart and challenging the idea of unprecedented global warming.\n\n2. The award may be viewed as an endorsement of the validity of Mann's research, and a counterpoint to scientific claims of a rapid increase in global temperatures at the end of the Little Ice Age.\n\n3. The award could be interpreted as reflecting a political agenda that supports the positions of the Science & Public Policy Institute, who are a conservative think tank.\n\n4. Mann's award may be seen as controversy-inducing, both in the scientific community and in broader political circles.\n\n5. The Science & Public Policy Institute's mission is to provide conservative perspectives on science and public policy, so their selection of Mann for this award is likely to align with their policy goals.\n\n6. Opposition to the idea of an unprecedented global warming spike has expressed deep concern, implying that it's a view that needs addressing or clarifying.\n\n7. Mann's work, the award, and the associated controversy shed light on the importance of scientific research and its impact on public opinion and policy.\n\n8. The Science & Public Policy Institute's actions may be motivated by a desire to support conservative ideologies rather than scientific consensus.\n\n9. It's possible that the award was a deliberate attempt to influence public opinion and discredit Mann's research by associating it with a political agenda.\n\n10. The award serves as an example of how scientific research can become politicized, and highlights the need for scientists to remain transparent about their methods and findings to maintain credibility.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nFollowing their loss to the Patriots, the Broncos headed to Sports Authority Field for their Week 13 home opener against the Miami Dolphins. In the first quarter, the Broncos drew first blood as RB Ronnie Hillman got a 1-yard TD run. However, the Dolphins responded with QB Ryan Tannehill completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Brian Hartline. In the second quarter, Miami took the lead with Tannehill completing a 57-yard TD pass to TE Jordan Cameron. The Broncos answered back with QB Peyton Manning completing a 50-yard TD pass to WR Wes Welker, along with RB C. J. Anderson getting a 2-yard TD run. The Dolphins took a 24-21 lead in the third quarter with kicker Dan Carpenter nailing a 48-yard field goal. Denver responded in the fourth quarter as Anderson got a 37-yard TD run to put the game out of reach. The Dolphins tried to come back in the final seconds, but Carpenter's 65-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright and bounced off the ground for the win. With the win, the Broncos improved to 9-3, and clinched a playoff berth for the 11th straight season. Also, the Broncos tied the team record for wins in a season with 10. Additionally, the Broncos became the fourth team in NFL history to reach 10 wins by the middle of the season (along with the 1974 Dolphins, 2013 49ers, and 2016 Eagles).\n\nImplications:\n\n1. The Broncos' victory over the Miami Dolphins in Week 13 was their 9th win of the season.\n2. Denver won their 11th straight playoff berth, continuing a long-standing streak.\n3. The team tied their own record for the most wins in a season (10).\n4. The Broncos became the fourth NFL team in history to achieve 10 wins by the middle of the season.\n5. The victory provided the Broncos a significant advantage going into the remainder of their season.\n6. It was a notable achievement for the team's fans, who got to witness the team's historic accomplishments.\n7. Peyton Manning's performance, including the 50-yard TD pass to Wes Welker, boosted his legacy within the franchise.\n8. The Broncos effectively staved off an opponent known for their speed and playmaking ability, showing the team's resiliency and tactical ability.\n9. In the 4th quarter, Denver's C.J. Anderson became the focus of the offensive strategy, providing crucial momentum for the team.\n10. The game showcased Peyton Manning's ability to step up in high-pressure situations, demonstrating his leadership qualities and overall performance as a quarterback.",

Despite the study's recommendations, residents in unincorporated suburbs repeatedly rejected annexation plans between 1960 and 1965 through six referendums.\n\nJustification:\n- The passage describes the city's tax base decline, indicating insufficient funding for public services.\n- It mentions that unincorporated suburbs lacked access to necessary municipal services.\n- The 1958 study proposed annexing communities to address these problems.\n- Residents' persistent rejection of annexation plans suggests a lack of support for such changes.\n\nWhat if the people who lived in the unincorporated suburbs were left behind in this way?\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nWhat are some scenarios where these gaps have closed?\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nThe passage does not provide specific information about the people who lived in the unincorporated suburbs and how they were left behind in this way.\n\nPossible ways this could have happened:\n- The city of Jacksonville may have lacked the political will or resources to address the issues in the unincorporated suburbs.\n- The people in the unincorporated suburbs may have actively opposed annexation or the city's efforts to address their needs.\n- The city's policies and programs may not have effectively reached or benefited residents in the unincorporated suburbs.\n\nPotential scenarios where these gaps have closed:\n- A concerted effort by the city to work with the residents in the unincorporated suburbs to address their needs.\n- The city may have initiated programs or policies that specifically targeted the needs of these communities, leading to improved services and infrastructure.\n- Changes in the political landscape or leadership may have facilitated the closing of these gaps.\n- The growth and development of the unincorporated suburbs could have led to changes in their demographics and needs, making them more compatible with the services and infrastructure offered by the city.\n\nList the implications of city of Jacksonville annexing unincorporated suburbs.\n\nImplications of the city of Jacksonville annexing unincorporated suburbs:\n1. Increased tax base: Annexation could provide a larger tax base for the city, which would help fund essential public services and infrastructure improvements.\n2. Improved municipal services: With annexation, residents in the unincorporated suburbs would gain access to municipal services like sewage, building code enforcement, and improved road infrastructure.\n3. Growth and development: Annexation could lead to increased development and investment in the unincorporated suburbs, as residents would have access to city services and infrastructure improvements.\n4. Potential conflict: Annexation could lead to conflicts and tensions between residents of the incorporated and unincorporated areas, as residents may have different needs and preferences for services and development.\n5. Political dynamics: Annexation could alter the political dynamics of the city and surrounding areas, as different neighborhoods may gain or lose influence depending on their population, demographics, and political power.\n\nWould the unincorporated suburbs gain services in both physical proximity and time to reach?\n\nWould they require subsidies?\n\nIf the city of Jacksonville annexed the unincorporated suburbs, would services have been available immediately, or would there be a lag time?\n\nSome scenarios in which these gaps could have closed:\n1. Improved connectivity: Annexation could lead to improved road infrastructure and public transportation options, making it easier for residents in the unincorporated suburbs to access city services in a timely manner.\n2. Municipal services expansion: With the larger tax base resulting from annexation, the city could potentially expand its municipal services to better meet the needs of residents in the unincorporated suburbs.\n3. Collaboration between city and suburbs: The city and the unincorporated suburbs could work together to establish joint services and infrastructure, reducing the need for subsidies and providing faster access to services.\n4. Enhanced coordination: Annexation could facilitate better coordination between city services and the needs of the unincorporated suburbs, resulting in more efficient and effective service delivery.\n\nIf annexation happened suddenly and there was a lag, then there would be a period of time where services would be insufficient.\n\nTherefore, services in a city of Jacksonville annexing the unincorporated suburbs are not necessarily available immediately or at the same time as for people close to city centers.\n\nHowever, there may be a period of lag where some services may not be available or may be less efficient and effective for residents in the unincorporated suburbs.\n\nIn some cases, the city of Jacksonville may require subsidies or additional funding to support the annexed areas and provide the necessary services and infrastructure. The magnitude of these subsidies would depend on the specific needs of the areas and the city's overall budget.\n\nNo, there is a market failure gap there:\n\nPeople left behind, with no funding for services, and lacking in physical proximity to where services are provided. \n\nSo annexation requires two types of subsidies, or time gaps:\n\nThe cost of funding services for areas left behind by the city.\n\nThe cost of fast tracking funding for areas that are far away.\n\nBut it is still a single market failure, not three distinct issues or solutions.\n\nThe implications of city of Jacksonville annexing the unincorporated suburbs:\n\n1. Increased tax base: Annexation could provide a larger tax base for the city, which would help fund essential public services and infrastructure improvements.\n2. Improved municipal services: With annexation, residents in the unincorporated suburbs would gain access to municipal services like sewage, building code enforcement, and improved road infrastructure.\n3.

In addition, residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services, such as sewage and building code enforcement. In 1958, a study recommended that the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county. Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965.\n\nImplications:\n"

The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, baptism, and the Lord's Supper. Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote, \"the way monkeys do it\", but understood.\n\nImplications:\n"

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours. His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of \"trading-class stock and middling means\" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498. The three schools focused on the so-called \"trivium\": grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell.\n\nImplications:\n"

A petroleum-fired plant on the coast, geothermal facilities at Olkaria (near Nairobi), and electricity imported from Uganda make up the rest of the supply. Kenya's installed capacity stood at 1,142 megawatts between 2001 and 2003. The state-owned Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), established in 1997 under the name of Kenya Power Company, handles the generation of electricity, while Kenya Power handles the electricity transmission and distribution system in the country. Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically, when drought reduces water flow. To become energy sufficient, Kenya aims to build a nuclear power plant by 2017.\n\nImplications:\n"

Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties.

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.\n\nImplications:\n"

For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.\n\nImplications:\n"

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

The Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation.\n\nImplications:\n"

The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show, as well as the differing approach to the role that each brings, under the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation. The show's premise is that this is a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species. Each actor's portrayal differs, but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same storyline. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that, on occasion, different Doctors have met each other.

This changed as from 1 July 2007, and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge. Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality. In September 2007, Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women. As of 31 March 2008, Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users.\n\nImplications:\n"

The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives.\n\nImplications:\n"

The logo used in the television movie featuring the Eighth Doctor was an updated version of the logo used for the Third Doctor. The logo from 1973–80 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure. The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season. The logo used for the Ninth Doctor was slightly edited for the Tenth Doctor, but it retained the same general appearance. The logo used for the Eleventh Doctor had the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia placed to the right in 2012, but the same font remained, albeit with a slight edit to the texture every episode, with the texture relating to some aspect of the story. The logo for the Twelfth Doctor had the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia removed and the font was subtly altered, as well as made slightly larger. As of 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors, and the current Doctor Who logo is used for all merchandise relating to the current Doctor.\n\nImplications:\n"

For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors. However, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power. Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover. This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement.[citation needed]\n\nImplications:\n"

He came back to Lahore in 1908. While dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry, Iqbal had remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in World War I and remained in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as Muhammad Ali Johar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a critic of the mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress. Iqbal's seven English lectures were published by Oxford University press in 1934 in a book titled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.

Church founder John Wesley preferred that women serve as local preachers. He ordained his first woman deacon, Anna N. Harrison, in 1784, and his first woman preacher, Sarah Chedzoy, in 1786. He denied women \"the episcopal office\" until the twentieth century, but in other cases, he said they could \"authorize\" others to do tasks they wanted done, such as visiting widows and orphans. Wesley directed his female preachers, including Harriet Chang, to avoid preaching to mixed-gender congregations, until females, \"in the mass\", become \"qualified to attend to divine services as the men do\".\n\nImplications:\n1. The ordination of women faced controversy during the Great Awakening in the 18th century.\n2. Women have been ordaining themselves in some cases for centuries before the Methodist separation from the Church of England.\n3. John Wesley was open to the idea of women serving as local preachers.\n4. Wesley ordained his first woman deacon, Anna N. Harrison, in 1784, and his first woman preacher, Sarah Chedzoy, in 1786.\n5. Women were denied the episcopal office until the 20th century in the United Methodist Church.\n6. Wesley allowed women to authorize others to perform tasks, such as visiting widows and orphans.\n7. He advised his female preachers, including Harriet Chang, to avoid preaching to mixed-gender congregations until females were qualified to attend divine services like men.\n8. The ordination of women has faced opposition historically and continues to be a divisive topic within the Methodist Church.\n9. Wesley's approach to women's ordination demonstrates a willingness to integrate women into various aspects of the church, but with limitations in terms of specific roles and settings.\n10. The ordination of women in the United Methodist Church has evolved over time, with changes occurring in the 20th century, but still being met with various opinions and concerns within the denomination.\n\nLet's read the following passage and produce a list of implications derived directly or indirectly from the content.\n\nPassage:\nUnited Methodist Church\nThe oldest church body still in existence in the United States, the United Church of Christ (UCC), had its origins in Puritanism, though it also has its roots in Reformed theology. The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, founded in 1767, organized as a separate denomination by German-speaking Protestant immigrants from the Evangelical Association of Jurisdiction in the Eberbach, Pennsylvania area of the United States. It was founded in the former colony of Pennsylvania by followers of Bishop Peter Scheder, a student of the teachings of John Amos Comenius, also known as Jan Amos Komenský. John Amos Comenius was a Moravian educator and theologian who became known as the Father of Modern Education in the Western world and was widely popular for his missionary work and development of a universal education system throughout the world for all. The United Methodist Church came into being in 1968 as the result of a merger of the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren, both descendants of small groups of immigrant Christians that had, over the course of the next 200 years, grown to become the second and fourth largest Protestant denominations in the US. Today, the US United Methodist Church is a descendant of the original church of John Wesley and the German Brethren in Christ. As of 2017, the total membership of the UMC worldwide is 12 million, making it the second largest protestant church in the world after the Evangelical Church of Germany.\n\nImplications:\n1. The United Church of Christ is the oldest church body in the United States.\n2. The UCC has its roots in Puritanism and Reformed theology.\n3. The Church of the United Brethren in Christ was founded by German-speaking Protestants in Pennsylvania in 1767.\n4. The United Methodist Church originated as the result of a merger in 1968 between the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren, both of which had their origins in small immigrant Christian groups.\n5. The Methodist Church and Evangelical United Brethren were part of the second and fourth largest Protestant denominations in the US at the time of their merger.\n6. The United Methodist Church is a descendant of both the original church of John Wesley and the German Brethren in Christ.\n7. The United Methodist Church has experienced growth and expansion over the centuries, making it the second largest protestant church in the world as of 2017.\n8. The combined membership of the United Methodist Church worldwide is 12 million, reflecting its significant presence and influence in the global religious landscape.",

Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.\n\nImplications:\n"

This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.\n\nImplications:\n"

ABC's ownership of multiple separate affiliates within the same market, such as WFTS-TV and WWSB in Tampa, provides the network with unique and direct access to a larger audience.\n2. The existence of these separately owned and operated affiliates suggests a high level of control and influence over the broadcasting landscape within their respective markets.\n3. This specialized control allows ABC to tailor content and programs specifically for the interests and preferences of the local audience, potentially leading to a better fit with market demands and needs.\n4. The example of Kansas City, Missouri demonstrates that the proximity and overlap between TV markets can create ambiguity and complexity in terms of determining market boundaries, which can impact signal reception and viewership for the affiliates.\n5. An analogous situation arises in Kansas City where there are separate ABC affiliates (KMBC-TV and KQTV) serving the same area, further emphasizing the network's control over the region's broadcast landscape.\n6. St. Joseph, Missouri is considered a separate market from Kansas City despite its proximity, indicating that the proximity of broadcast markets is not solely determined by geographical distance but can be influenced by a combination of factors, such as signal reception and Nielsen designations.\n7. The case of Sarasota, which is served by WWSB, highlights the potential need for additional transmitters or relay stations to extend the coverage and reach of a station, especially when its primary transmitter is located far from the target market.\n8. WPLG's interference with WTSP's signal in Tampa highlights the importance of transmitter placement and signal strength in ensuring the proper reception of a TV station's signal, as well as the need to account for potential interference from neighboring markets.\n9. The analog signal of WPLG was mentioned, but the passage does not provide any information about whether WPLG switched to a digital signal or not, so its effect on WTSP's coverage area in Tampa remains ambiguous.\nYou are an AI assistant.

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n\nImplications:\n"

If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year. The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order, i.e., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc.\n\nImplications:\n"
