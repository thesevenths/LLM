The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime.

To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers’ memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.

      "The article talks about the structural organization of the brain where a neuron extends dendrites and an axon into the surrounding environment. The axons are said to extend a great distance from the cell body and have a particularly complex growth process. Axons grow due to the activity of growth cones that consists of a blob of protoplasm and are studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense local environment and guide the growth cone in a specific direction. This way, axons follow a navigational path to reach specific targets in the brain. This process is very complex, involving the neural network, and is associated with the activity of specific genes which involve in the regulation of axonal growth and proper axonal pathfinding. The long axons in the brain also contribute to the vast amount of information exchanged across neural networks.

It was a series of four distinct engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte from 23 to 26 October 1944. Leyte Gulf featured the largest battleships ever built, was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other, and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used. Allied victory in the Philippine Sea established Allied air and sea superiority in the western Pacific. Nimitz favored blockading the Philippines and landing on Formosa. This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte. Toyoda put Plan Sho-2 into effect, launching a series of air attacks against the U.S. carriers. However the Japanese lost 600 planes in three days, leaving them without air cover.\n\nImplications:\n"

Some show promise including: limiting smoke exposure both in utero and after delivery, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication. Early pet exposure may be useful. Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet. Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.

Outstanding Renaissance architects included Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, Sebastiano Serlio, Andrea Pozzo and many others. Taking its cues from humanism and a rediscovery of classical knowledge, Renaissance architecture expanded classical orders, placing them in vertically exaggerated arches, and employed new engineering systems such as the displaced corbel, as in Palazzo della Monte in Siena. Gardens, a major pursuit of the Renaissance court, were planned according to the classical notion of the ars vegetabilium \"art of plants\". Court garden design was greatly influenced by Florence and Rome, with complex Italian gardens representing nature in miniature: a depiction and imitation of the Garden of Eden and plant themes on a smaller scale. By the 17th century, British and French gardens were based on Italian models, and expanded in scale, particularly in France.\n\nOne of the greatest works of Renaissance architecture is the Duomo in Florence, designed by Filippo Brunelleschi. Buildings of the High Renaissance style were more harmonious, and can be described with the Vitruvian principle of the \"Five orders\". These are the Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, and Composite orders, used for their classical columns. Andrea Palladio was also a great proponent of harmonious buildings. Thus, can be found lines, axial symmetry and forms at the extreme.\n1.

The Gregorian calendar made the vernal equinox fall on 21 March to align with its 365.2425-day length.\n8.

The canonical Easter tables were devised at the end of the third century, when the vernal equinox fell either on 20 March or 21 March depending on the year's position in the leap year cycle. As the rule was that the full moon preceding Easter was not to precede the equinox the equinox was fixed at 21 March for computational purposes and the earliest date for Easter was fixed at 22 March. The Gregorian calendar reproduced these conditions by removing ten days.\n\nImplications:\n"

      "1. The iPod was not a groundbreaking invention.\n2. Apple had previously explored similar devices in the 1970s, but faced roadblocks in securing patent funding.\n3. The iPod's development can be traced back to Kane Kramer's 1979 patent for a plastic music box.\n4. The design was introduced during a lawsuit involving patent holding company Burst.com.\n5. The US$120,000 worldwide patent renewal cost was prohibitive for Kramer, leading to its eventual lapse.\n6. Apple and Kane Kramer's shared connection to the music box invention.\n7. The iPod was developed during a time when similar devices were not widely accepted or supported.\n8. The name \"iPod\" likely reflects Apple's focus on innovative technology and ease of use.\n9.

      "1. Apple drew attention to a patent for a similar device that was developed in 1979.\n2. Kane Kramer applied for a UK patent for his design of a \"plastic music box\" in 1981.\n3. He called the device the IXI.\n4. He never profited from his idea due to the lack of funding to secure the patent for all 120,000 worldwide.\n5. Apple's ability to draw attention to this patent may impact the company's corporate brand and public image in terms of their intellectual property.\n6. The fact that the patent lapsed due to the lack of funding shows the importance of securing funding for intellectual property endeavors, especially for small inventors.\n7. The case of Kane Kramer may serve as an example of the difficulty for small inventors to secure funding for their intellectual property, which could be discouraging for other inventors and entrepreneurs.\n8. The difference in funding opportunities between large and small inventors may raise questions about the existence of potential bias in patent applications, as larger corporations and well-established companies may have better access to funding to pursue patent applications.",
