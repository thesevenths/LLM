      "1.  \nGenghis Khan  \nThe Shah’s army was weakened by internal disputes and further by his choice to scatter his troops across various cities. This division proved critical to Khwarezmia’s defeats, as the Mongols, despite their exhaustion from the journey, were able to pick off isolated Khwarezmian groups instead of confronting the full army at once. The Mongols rapidly captured the town of Otrar through superior tactics. Genghis Khan then had most of the civilians massacred, enslaved the survivors, and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes as punishment for his deeds. As the battle concluded, the Shah escaped rather than give in to the Mongols.

This fragmentation enabled the Mongols, worn from travel, to defeat the Shah’s forces in smaller, divided segments. Otrar was quickly taken by the Mongols using their superior strategies. Genghis Khan responded with a brutal massacre of civilians, enslaved the rest, and ordered the grisly execution of Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes—all as retribution. Instead of surrendering, the Shah fled as his armies collapsed. Genghis Khan assigned Subutai and Jebe, with 20,000 troops and two years, to track him. The Shah’s fate was sealed when he died mysteriously on an isolated island within his own lands.\n\n3.  \nGenghis Khan  \nInternal rivalries and the Shah’s plan to disperse his army into smaller city garrisons left his forces divided—a weakness the Mongols exploited to devastating effect. Arriving after a long march, the Mongols could destroy Khwarezmia’s fragmented army in stages, never having to fight the entire force together. Otrar fell to them swiftly, thanks to cunning leadership and battlefield tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the slaughter of many townspeople, took the rest as slaves, and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes in revenge. As defeat loomed, the Shah escaped capture. Genghis Khan tasked Subutai and Jebe with 20,000 men—and gave them two years—to find the Shah, who ultimately died in ambiguous circumstances on a secluded island within his dominion.",

The Mongols swiftly captured Otrar, using their superior military planning. Genghis Khan commanded the mass killing of many civilians, enslaved those who survived, and killed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes as punishment for his deeds.

Genghis Khan then dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 20,000 troops, granting them two years to capture the Shah, who ultimately died under mysterious conditions on a remote island in his domain.\n\n2.  \nGenghis Khan  \nRiddled with internal strife and weakened by fragmentation, the Shah’s army lost its strength when he split his troops among various cities. This proved to be a critical error, as the Mongols, already weary from their travels, were able to eliminate smaller groups of Khwarzemi soldiers individually instead of confronting a consolidated resistance. Exploiting their tactical advantage, the Mongol army quickly overtook the city of Otrar. Following this victory, Genghis Khan had most of the civilians killed, with the remainder enslaved, and punished Inalchuq by executing him with molten silver poured into his ears and eyes. The Shah escaped rather than surrendering, prompting Genghis Khan to send Subutai and Jebe with a force of 20,000, instructing them to pursue the Shah for up to two years. Eventually, the Shah died mysteriously on a secluded island within his own realm.\n\n3.  \nGenghis Khan  \nThe Shah’s army suffered from infighting and was further weakened when he chose to split his forces, deploying them in multiple cities. This disunity played into the Mongols’ hands, as it enabled them to overcome individual Khwarzemi detachments rather than a unified army, despite being tired from their journey. The Mongol forces quickly conquered Otrar through effective strategy and tactics. In retribution for past wrongs, Genghis Khan ordered most civilians killed, the survivors enslaved, and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes. Towards the battle's conclusion, the Shah fled to avoid capture. Genghis Khan directed Subutai and Jebe, along with 20,000 soldiers, to pursue him for two years. Ultimately, the Shah died under unclear circumstances on a small island in his territory.\n\n4.  \nGenghis Khan  \nPlagued by internal divisions and the Shah’s tendency to spread his troops thinly across several cities, the Khwarezmian army was vulnerable. This fragmentation allowed the Mongols, though tired from their extensive march, to attack and defeat smaller enemy groups separately, avoiding direct confrontation with a larger, united force. The Mongols soon took Otrar, leveraging their superior tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the killing of many civilians, the enslavement of the rest, and a brutal execution for Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes as payback.

The Mongols, despite being fatigued from their journey, took advantage by defeating the scattered Khwarazmian troops in smaller engagements. They soon captured the city of Otrar, leveraging their superior strategies. Genghis Khan then commanded the massacre of numerous civilians, enslaved the remainder, and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes as punishment for his actions. As the battle concluded, the Shah opted to flee instead of surrender. Genghis Khan tasked Subutai and Jebe with tracking the Shah down, giving them 20,000 troops and a two-year period to complete their mission. The Shah ultimately died mysteriously on a remote island in his territory.\n\n3.  \nGenghis Khan  \nThe Shah’s forces were weakened by infighting and his own policy of dividing his army among multiple cities. This breakdown allowed the Mongols, tired from a lengthy trek, to pick off segments of the Khwarazmian army rather than confronting a solid defense. The Mongol army soon took the town of Otrar, using superior tactical skills. Following the conquest, Genghis Khan ordered the slaughter of much of the civilian population, enslaved the rest, and had Inalchuq executed by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as payback for his actions. Towards the end of the campaign, the Shah escaped rather than surrendering. Genghis Khan then dispatched Subutai and Jebe, each with troops, giving them two years and 20,000 men to track the Shah.

This division was vital to Khwarezmia’s defeat, because it enabled the Mongols—despite their exhaustion—to fight and win against smaller enemy contingents instead of a single unified army. The Mongol forces soon captured Otrar by employing superior planning and tactics. Afterward, Genghis Khan ordered that many civilians be massacred, the survivors enslaved, and Inalchuq executed horrifyingly with molten silver poured into his ears and eyes as punishment for his deeds.

      "1.  \nThe Shah's army was weakened by internal conflicts and his own choice to split his forces among several cities. This lack of unity led to Khwarezmia's downfall, as the Mongols could focus on defeating scattered enemy groups instead of confronting one large army.

Genghis Khan then commanded the massacre of many civilians and enslaved the survivors, while the governor Inalchuq was gruesomely executed with molten silver as punishment. As the battle was ending, the Shah escaped rather than give up. Genghis Khan assigned Subutai and Jebe, with 20,000 soldiers and a two-year deadline, to pursue him. Eventually, the Shah died mysteriously on an isolated island.\n\n2.  \nInternal rivalries and the Shah’s choice to split his army led to Khwarezmia’s crushing defeats. The Mongols, even after a hard journey, were able to defeat the dispersed units one by one. Demonstrating strategic prowess, they quickly took Otrar. Genghis Khan ordered a brutal punishment—he had civilians massacred, the rest enslaved, and the captured Inalchuq executed with molten silver poured into his ears and eyes. The Shah fled the battlefield rather than surrender, and Subutai and Jebe were tasked with hunting him down, given a considerable force and two years. The Shah eventually died in unclear circumstances on an island.\n\n3.  \nThe Shah’s forces, divided by both infighting and his strategic dispersal of troops, failed to offer a unified resistance to the Mongols. This allowed Genghis Khan’s army, though weary from travel, to overpower the fragmented defenders, starting with the swift capture of Otrar. Following the victory, Genghis Khan ordered the slaughter and enslavement of the population, and Inalchuq was executed in a particularly cruel manner. The Shah chose to flee before surrendering; in response, Genghis sent Subutai and Jebe with 20,000 troops to pursue him for up to two years. The Shah ultimately died under mysterious conditions on a remote island.\n\n4.  \nBecause the Shah divided his army between various cities and his commanders were engaged in infighting, Khwarezmia’s forces were easily defeated by the Mongols. The Mongol army wasted no time in conquering Otrar using their advanced strategy. In retaliation for earlier offenses, Genghis Khan ordered the killing and enslavement of the townspeople, and executed Inalchuq with molten silver.

      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nUnder European Union law, Treaties and Regulations can have direct effect if they are clear, unconditional, and immediate. In contrast, Directives do not typically allow individual citizens to sue one another; they are mainly binding on member states. This is rooted in TFEU article 288, which states that Directives are directed at member states and let national authorities decide how to implement them. Often, Directives establish only minimum standards, while countries can set higher requirements. For example, although the Working Time Directive guarantees at least four weeks of paid holiday per year, most countries offer more in their national laws. According to the current interpretation by the Court of Justice, individuals can only base claims on national laws made to implement Directives, not the Directives themselves. Thus, Directives do not have \"horizontal\" direct effect, meaning they can't be enforced directly between private individuals. This approach has been controversial; in the early 1990s, three Advocate Generals argued Directives should create rights and obligations for everyone. Nevertheless, the Court of Justice disagreed, though five major exceptions do exist.\n\n2.  \nIn EU law, Treaties and Regulations are directly effective when they are precise and unconditional, but Directives usually do not let citizens bring actions against other citizens. This stems from article 288 of the TFEU, which directs Directives at member states and allows them to decide how to achieve objectives. Directives generally set minimum requirements, letting countries go beyond what is required. For instance, the Working Time Directive mandates a minimum of four weeks' paid vacation annually, but many member states offer more. Presently, the Court of Justice holds that individuals can rely on national laws that derive from Directives, but not the Directives themselves, meaning Directives lack horizontal direct effect between private parties. This interpretation has been challenged, especially in the 1990s when some Advocate Generals suggested Directives should apply to everyone. The Court refused, although it recognizes five significant exceptions.\n\n3.  \nAccording to EU law, Treaties and Regulations can apply directly to individuals if they are sufficiently clear and unconditional. However, Directives are not generally intended to give citizens the right to take legal action against each other; such rights are meant for the member states. This principle is supported by article 288 of the TFEU, which specifies that Directives are addressed to member states and leaves it up to them to choose how to enforce them. Directives typically set basic standards that countries can exceed. For example, although all workers in the EU are entitled to at least four weeks of paid leave, many countries provide more. The Court of Justice's current position is that people must rely on their national laws implementing Directives, rather than the Directives, since Directives do not produce horizontal direct effect. This stance has been controversial—some Advocate Generals in the early 1990s strongly advocated for Directives to create rights and obligations for all. While the Court did not agree, it did introduce five significant exceptions.\n\n4.  \nIn the European Union legal system, Treaties and Regulations are directly effective when no further action is needed, but Directives mostly do not let private individuals sue one another. The reasoning lies in TFEU article 288, which says Directives are for member states to implement as they see fit. Such flexibility often means Directives set minimum levels, and national law can be stricter. For instance, having at least 4 weeks' paid holiday is a Directive, though most countries give more. The CJEU currently holds that only national laws implementing Directives may be grounds for legal claims by individuals, not the Directives themselves. As a result, Directives do not have horizontal direct effect, a decision that has sparked debate, especially when three Advocate Generals urged for broader citizen rights from Directives in the 90s. The Court disagreed but allowed five major exceptions to this general rule.",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nUnder European Union law, Treaties and Regulations generally have direct effect if their provisions are clear, unconditional, and immediate. In contrast, Directives usually do not give individuals the right to sue other individuals, according to TFEU article 288, because Directives are addressed to member states and let those states choose how to implement them. This is partly because Directives often set minimum standards, allowing countries to exceed those requirements. For instance, the Working Time Directive sets a minimum of four weeks’ paid holiday for workers, but many countries offer more. Currently, individuals can rely on national laws that implement Directives, but cannot directly invoke the Directives themselves against other individuals—known as the absence of \"horizontal\" direct effect. Although several Advocate Generals in the 1990s suggested Directives should provide rights and obligations to everyone, the Court of Justice maintained its position, except for five notable exceptions.\n\n2.  \nIn EU law, Treaties and Regulations may have direct effect if they are straightforward and precise, but Directives mainly do not allow citizens to take legal action against one another. This is explained by TFEU article 288, which directs Directives at member states and gives them the flexibility to choose how to achieve the required results. Directives often establish minimum requirements, and countries can impose stricter rules if desired. For example, the Working Time Directive mandates at least four weeks paid vacation, though many countries go beyond this. At present, courts allow people to make claims based on the national implementation of Directives, not the Directives themselves, as Directives generally lack horizontal direct effect. Although this stance was challenged by several Advocate Generals in the 1990s, the Court of Justice largely upheld it, apart from five significant exceptions.\n\n3.  \nAccording to European Union legal principles, Treaties and Regulations may be directly enforced by citizens if they are unambiguous and self-executing. By contrast, Directives are typically aimed at member states, not individuals, and usually require the implementation of their provisions through national legislation. Article 288 of the TFEU states that Directives give countries discretion in how they are put into practice. Directives frequently set basic minimum standards, which countries can exceed; for example, the EU’s Working Time Directive ensures at least four weeks’ paid leave for workers, while national laws often offer more. The current rule is that individuals can only rely on national laws based on Directives, not on Directives alone, meaning Directives do not generally have \"horizontal\" direct effect. Although the idea that Directives should directly affect private parties was supported by some Advocate Generals in the 1990s, the Court of Justice did not accept it, save for five major exceptions.\n\n4.  \nEuropean Union law distinguishes between the direct effect of Treaties and Regulations, which applies provided the rules are clear and unconditional, and the effect of Directives, which typically do not permit individuals to bring cases against each other. Article 288 of the TFEU explains that Directives are addressed to member states, giving them freedom to decide how to implement them. This allows Directives to set minimum standards while letting states go further if they wish; for instance, the Working Time Directive ensures at least four weeks’ holiday but many nations offer more. According to the Court of Justice, individuals can invoke rights from national laws derived from Directives, but not from the Directives themselves, as these lack \"horizontal\" direct effect. This restrictive interpretation was debated in the 1990s, with some legal advisors proposing a broader effect for Directives, but the Court mostly maintained its view, with just a few exceptions.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more versions or adjustments to style or complexity!",
      "Sure! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nEuropean Union law distinguishes between Treaties, Regulations, and Directives regarding their legal effects. Treaties and Regulations are directly effective, provided their provisions are clear and unconditional, allowing individuals to rely on them in court. In contrast, Directives are primarily addressed to member states, not individuals, as stated in TFEU article 288. This means Directives guide member states on achieving certain outcomes but let them choose the method of implementation, which often leads to minimum standards being set (such as the Working Time Directive's 4 weeks paid holiday, even though national laws may provide more). Therefore, under current Court of Justice interpretation, individuals can base claims on domestic laws implementing Directives, but not on the Directives themselves, as Directives lack \"horizontal\" direct effect. While this interpretation was hotly debated—three Advocate Generals in the 1990s argued Directives should create direct rights and obligations between citizens—the Court disagreed, though it did recognize several important exceptions.\n\n2.  \nUnder EU law, Treaties and Regulations can be invoked directly by individuals in certain conditions, but Directives generally cannot be used by citizens to sue other individuals. Article 288 of the TFEU explains that Directives are directed at member states, allowing national authorities to determine how to put them into effect. Often, Directives set basic requirements, like the minimum four-week paid holiday established by the Working Time Directive, but countries often exceed these standards with their own laws. Currently, the EU Court of Justice holds that people can challenge national laws that implement Directives but cannot rely on the Directives directly in cases involving other private parties—meaning Directives have no \"horizontal\" direct effect. This stance has been controversial, especially when several legal advisors argued for broader individual rights under Directives in the 1990s, but the Court maintained its position, save for five major exceptions.\n\n3.  \nIn the context of EU law, while Treaties and Regulations can sometimes be enforced directly by individuals if their content is straightforward and unconditional, Directives generally do not allow for such directness between private parties. According to TFEU article 288, Directives are meant for member states, granting them flexibility in how they achieve EU goals. For instance, the Working Time Directive sets a basic standard of four weeks vacation, but many countries go further. As it stands, the European Court of Justice permits individuals to enforce rights derived from national laws that implement Directives, but not the Directives alone, meaning there is no \"horizontal\" direct effect. This approach caused controversy, with legal advocates in the 1990s urging the Court to allow Directives to be fully enforceable by anyone, but the Court resisted, with exceptions in five significant areas.\n\n4.  \nEU law makes a distinction between the legal effects of Treaties, Regulations, and Directives. Treaties and Regulations can take effect directly for individuals under certain circumstances, but Directives cannot usually be used by citizens to bring claims against other citizens. This is based on article 288 of the TFEU, which says Directives are addressed to the member states and gives them some discretion in implementation—often setting a minimum but letting countries do more if they wish (like with paid annual leave). The European Court of Justice currently rules that citizens can only base legal actions on the national laws that result from Directives, not the Directives themselves, as Directives lack horizontal direct effect. While some legal experts pushed for broader citizen-to-citizen rights under Directives in the 1990s, the Court has maintained this limit other than for five main exceptions.",
      "1.  \nEuropean Union law distinguishes between Treaties and Regulations, which can have a direct effect if they are clear, unconditional, and immediate, and Directives, which generally do not allow individuals to sue other individuals based solely on their content. This is because, according to TFEU article 288, Directives are targeted at member states and allow national authorities to choose how to implement them. Directives often set minimum standards, and it's up to member states to impose stricter rules if they wish; for example, while the Working Time Directive sets a minimum of four weeks of paid holiday, many countries require more. Presently, the Court of Justice holds that individuals can claim rights conferred by national laws implementing Directives, but not directly from the Directives themselves. Directives, therefore, do not have \"horizontal\" direct effect, meaning they generally can’t be used directly in disputes between private parties. This approach has been debated, and some Advocate Generals in the 1990s argued that Directives should also create individual rights and obligations, but the Court did not agree—though there are several significant exceptions to this rule.\n\n2.  \nIn EU law, Treaties and Regulations may have direct effect if their provisions are explicit and sufficiently precise, but Directives usually don’t let citizens take legal action against other citizens. This is rooted in TFEU article 288, which stipulates that Directives are addressed to member states, granting them the flexibility to decide how best to achieve the Directive's aims. Typically, Directives prescribe minimum requirements but let member states impose higher standards, such as the Working Time Directive's four-week paid leave, even though most countries grant more days off. According to current Court of Justice decisions, individuals can rely on national laws that enact Directives when making claims, but not the Directives themselves, as they lack what is called \"horizontal\" direct effect—meaning they can’t be invoked in disputes between private parties. Although this stance was challenged by several Advocate Generals in the 1990s, the Court refused to change the doctrine, though there are notable exceptions to this general principle.\n\n3.  \nUnder European Union law, while Treaties and Regulations can be directly effective if they are clear and immediate in their terms, Directives do not usually allow citizens to sue each other based on their contents. The rationale is that, per article 288 of the TFEU, Directives are for member states to implement in their own way, often setting only minimum standards and leaving states free to provide more. For example, while EU law mandates at least 4 weeks' paid holiday via the Working Time Directive, most national laws grant more generous leave. Right now, EU citizens are only allowed to rely on national laws derived from Directives—not on the Directives directly—when bringing legal actions, as Directives lack \"horizontal\" direct effect between private parties. This approach sparked controversy, and some legal experts, including three Advocate Generals in the 1990s, argued for Directives to be directly effective between individuals, but the Court did not accept this argument, although there are five major exceptions.",

This is partly because Directives set only minimum standards, so countries can go beyond them—like with the Working Time Directive requiring at least four weeks paid holiday, though most countries set higher levels. Under current Court of Justice rulings, individuals can make claims based on their national law that reflects a Directive, but not directly from the Directive itself, which does not provide \"horizontal\" direct effect between private parties. This approach has been debated, and in the 1990s, several Advocate Generals argued that Directives should create rights against all, but the Court rejected this, though five significant exceptions exist.\n\n2.  \nEuropean Union law  \nAccording to EU law, Treaties and Regulations with specific and unconditional language have a direct effect and can be invoked by individuals. In contrast, Directives are aimed at member states, according to Article 288 TFEU, and generally give national governments the flexibility to decide on the method of implementation. Directives set minimum standards—such as the Working Time Directive’s requirement of at least four weeks’ paid vacation, though most countries choose to exceed this. At present, the Court of Justice allows citizens to rely on national laws based on Directives, but not on the Directives themselves, meaning Directives do not have \"horizontal\" direct effect between private parties. This stance was contested in the early 1990s, with arguments made for a broader effect, but the Court disagreed, except for five notable exceptions.\n\n3.  \nEuropean Union law  \nWhile clear, unconditional, and immediate Treaties and Regulations can be directly enforced by individuals, Directives under EU law are generally directed only at states, not individuals. Article 288 of the TFEU explains that Directives are to be carried out by member states, which decide how to implement them, often by creating minimum requirements that may be exceeded by national laws, such as requiring more than the four weeks’ paid holiday provided in the Working Time Directive. As a result, individuals can rely on national laws derived from Directives, but not on Directives alone, because they do not apply directly between non-state actors (no \"horizontal\" direct effect). Though this has been controversial—three Advocate Generals in the 1990s advocated for a broader interpretation—it remains the Court of Justice’s position, except in five major cases.\n\n4.  \nEuropean Union law  \nUnder EU law, Treaties and Regulations can sometimes have direct effect, meaning they can be applied by individuals when they are explicit and leave no room for discretion. Directives differ because, according to Article 288 of the TFEU, they are addressed to member states and allow those states to choose how to implement them. They often establish only minimum standards, like the Working Time Directive's four-week holiday minimum, but many member states voluntarily set higher standards. The current legal view, as set by the Court of Justice, is that people can bring claims based on national laws implementing Directives, but not directly on the Directives themselves, which do not operate between private citizens (\"horizontal\" direct effect). This approach has been a matter of dispute, and although some legal advisers to the Court once argued for making Directives universally enforceable, the Court has maintained its stance, with five primary exceptions."

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a few different ways, each one separated by a newline.\n\nPassage:\nEuropean Union law\nWhile the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate), Directives do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens. In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties). This view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens. The Court of Justice refused, but there are five large exceptions.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

To this day, Genghis Khan is celebrated in Mongolia as the founder of their empire and the foundation of their nation.",
      "1.  \nGenghis Khan stands out as a major figure in the history of Mongolia. He played a key role in uniting the Mongol tribes, who previously lacked a shared political or ethnic identity, despite their similar cultures. By strengthening Mongol traditions and bringing stability amid near-constant tribal conflicts, he created a more unified nation. Genghis Khan is also acknowledged for introducing the traditional Mongolian script and establishing the Ikh Zasag, the first codified set of Mongolian laws. According to President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, these laws dealt seriously with corruption and bribery, and Genghis Khan sought justice and equal treatment for everyone, regardless of their social standing. In marking Genghis Khan’s 850th birthday, President Elbegdorj highlighted that true justice is founded on equal laws rather than on differences between people, and that lasting laws are more significant than impressive buildings. Ultimately, for Mongolians, Genghis Khan is considered the essential founder of their empire, and thus, their nation.\n\n2.  \nRegarded as a towering leader in Mongolian history, Genghis Khan was instrumental in transforming the Mongols into a unified group, both politically and ethnically. Before his leadership, the tribes shared cultural links but lacked a common identity. He strengthened their customs and provided peace and coherence during an age of frequent intertribal wars. Genghis Khan is credited with standardizing the Mongolian script and enacting the Ikh Zasag, the nation’s earliest written laws. Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted these laws imposed tough penalties for corruption, reflecting Genghis Khan’s vision of equal legal protection for all. Elbegdorj praised Genghis Khan for his understanding that true justice is based on legal equality, not social division, and for recognizing that meaningful laws outlast great architecture. As a result, Genghis Khan is viewed as the cornerstone of the Mongol Empire and the nation’s origin.\n\n3.  \nGenghis Khan is celebrated as a significant figure in Mongolia’s past. He was responsible for uniting the culturally similar but politically fragmented Mongol tribes, forging a shared sense of identity. He upheld traditional Mongol values and brought about a period of stability at a time when tribal warfare was widespread. Among his many achievements are the introduction of the Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag, Mongolia’s first set of written laws. As President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has pointed out, these laws were notable for their harsh stance against corruption, and Genghis Khan championed the idea that all citizens, regardless of their wealth or status, deserved equal legal protection. In a commemorative speech, Elbegdorj stressed that Genghis Khan valued equality before the law over distinctions among people and understood that lasting institutions are more important than physical monuments. Thus, Mongolians honor Genghis Khan as the foundational leader of their empire and the basis of their nation.\n\n4.  \nIn Mongolia's history, Genghis Khan is recognized as an outstanding leader. He unified various tribes, who were culturally similar but lacked a common identity and political cohesion. Genghis Khan preserved key Mongol traditions and brought unity to a region plagued by almost constant tribal warfare. He is also celebrated for introducing the classic Mongolian script and establishing the first written Mongolian law, the Ikh Zasag. President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has remarked that these laws dealt strictly with corruption and bribery, reflecting Genghis Khan’s desire for justice through equal laws for all people, regardless of their position. In a speech marking the 850th anniversary of Genghis Khan's birth, Elbegdorj underlined that Genghis Khan believed in the lasting power of fair laws, not just impressive buildings. For Mongolians today, he is seen as the central figure in the creation of both their empire and their modern nation."

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a few different ways, each one separated by a newline.\n\nPassage:\nGenghis Khan\nGenghis Khan is regarded as one of the prominent leaders in Mongolia's history. He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Despite this, the Yuan government often saw civil and military functions overlap due to Mongol traditions that emphasized military authority. Still, a civilian bureaucracy led by the Central Secretariat—which oversaw most agencies, including the Six Ministries—was set up.

Key components, inspired by historical Chinese dynasties and nomadic empires, were integrated, with early advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu guiding these changes. The main governmental structure was established early in Kublai’s rule, modeling the classical Chinese system which separated civil, military, and censory functions through bodies like the Central Secretariat, Privy Council, and Censorate. However, the Mongol preference for military-based administration led to significant overlap between civil and military roles. Despite this, a comprehensive bureaucracy was put in place, with the Central Secretariat at its center overseeing important functions such as those performed by the Six Ministries. On occasion, another high-level agency, the Department of State Affairs, was also formed to handle finances, though these efforts were usually temporary.\n\n3.  \nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan established a bureaucracy that drew from a variety of cultures represented within the empire, including the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists.

Key Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu were highly influential, and the Chinese-style elements of governance came mainly from the Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties. Early on, Kublai set up a central government that followed the Chinese model of separating authority among civil, military, and censorial offices. This included the Central Secretariat in charge of civil affairs, the Privy Council for military issues, and the Censorate for inspection and monitoring. Nonetheless, Mongol traditions meant civil and military responsibilities often overlapped. Despite this, a central civil bureaucracy headed by the Central Secretariat (which oversaw most other offices, like the Six Ministries) was established in China. Sometimes, a Department of State Affairs managed finances, but this office was usually temporary and soon disbanded.",

Here are a few rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan created a government bureaucracy that drew upon multiple cultures present within his empire, including the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. Although the names of many governmental institutions made them resemble those of traditional Chinese dynasties, the Yuan system was actually a fusion of various cultural influences. Much of the Chinese influence was inherited from previous dynasties like the Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin. Advisors such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu played a significant role in shaping Kublai’s early administration, establishing a central government within the first ten years of his rule. This administration followed the Chinese practice of dividing authority between civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat for civil affairs, the Privy Council for military oversight, and the Censorate for internal monitoring. However, there was considerable overlap between civil and military roles due to Mongol traditions. Despite this, a civilian bureaucracy emerged, headed by the Central Secretariat, which supervised most other agencies, including the Six Ministries. Occasionally, a Department of State Affairs was set up to handle finances, as during the reign of Külüg Khan, but it typically did not last long.\n\n2.  \nKublai Khan’s Yuan dynasty administration was a unique blend of several cultures from his vast empire, notably the Chinese, Khitan, Jurchen, Mongol, and Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The institutions had Chinese names and appeared similar to earlier native dynasties, but actually incorporated features from a range of societies. Chinese components came mainly from the Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties. Influential Chinese advisors like Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu helped shape the early Yuan government, which was organized within Kublai’s first decade as emperor. The government structure followed the established Chinese model of splitting authority among civil, military, and censorial branches, with institutions like the Central Secretariat (for civil matters), Privy Council (for the military), and Censorate (for inspections). Despite this, Mongol preferences for military institutions led to significant overlap between civil and military responsibilities. Nevertheless, a recognizable civilian bureaucracy surfaced under the Central Secretariat, managing most government departments such as the Six Ministries. At times, a Department of State Affairs was created to oversee finances, but it was typically short-lived.\n\n3.  \nThe Yuan dynasty bureaucracy, established by Kublai Khan, integrated influences from multiple cultures within the empire, such as the Han Chinese, Mongols, Khitans, Jurchens, and Tibetan Buddhists. Although it used familiar Chinese governmental terminology, the Yuan system was truly a blend of various traditions. Features resembling those of the Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties made up the Chinese segment of this administration. Key advisors including Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu had a major impact on the formation of the new central government, which emerged within the first decade of Kublai’s reign. The structure followed the standard Chinese division of civil, military, and censorial powers, with major offices like the Central Secretariat (civil administration), Privy Council (military command), and Censorate (internal oversight). However, the lines between civil and military duties often blurred due to Mongol reliance on military structures. Still, a civilian government system was maintained, with the Central Secretariat at its summit, overseeing agencies such as the Six Ministries. Occasionally, the Department of State Affairs managed financial matters but was usually soon dissolved."

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

If such an external force is applied, the center of mass accelerates in proportion to the force divided by the total mass of the system.\n\n2.  \nWithin a closed system, internal forces cancel each other out, meaning that the mutual pushes and pulls between the objects do not cause the system’s center of mass to speed up or slow down. The members of the system may move with respect to one another, but the system as a whole remains at rest or moves with constant velocity unless an outside force is present. In the presence of an external force, the center of mass will accelerate, according to the strength of that force divided by the system’s mass.\n\n3.  \nA closed system of particles has balanced internal forces, so the action-reaction pairs between objects inside the system don't produce any acceleration of the center of mass. While individual objects may move differently relative to one another, the system itself won’t accelerate unless an outside force is applied, in which case the acceleration of the center of mass equals the external force divided by the system’s mass.\n\n4.  \nWhen dealing with a closed system, the internal forces shared between objects do not result in any net effect on the center of mass’s motion; these forces only cause changes in position among the constituent particles. The entire system will only accelerate if there is an external force, and then the acceleration of the center of mass matches the external force divided by the system’s total mass.",
      "1.  \nIn a closed system of particles, all internal forces are balanced, so they don't cause the system's center of mass to move.

However, if an outside force acts on the system, the center of mass will accelerate at a rate equal to the external force divided by the system's total mass.\n\n2.  \nWithin a closed system, the internal forces always come in action-reaction pairs and cancel out, meaning the center of mass does not accelerate due to these internal interactions. The only movement is of the components relative to each other. If an external force is applied, the center of mass will accelerate in proportion to the force and inversely to the system's mass.\n\n3.  \nA closed system of particles experiences no unbalanced internal forces, so the center of mass remains stationary unless acted upon by something outside the system.

When an external force is present, the acceleration of the center of mass is equal to that force divided by the system's mass.\n\n4.  \nIf there are no external influences, the internal forces in a closed particle system cancel and do not alter the system's overall motion; only the relative motion between particles changes. The center of mass stays at rest or moves at a constant velocity. If an external force is applied, the center of mass accelerates at a rate determined by dividing the force by the total mass of the system.",

Any force exchanged between objects in the system only changes their motion relative to each other, not the motion of the overall system.

Within a closed system, internal forces cancel each other out, ensuring that the system's center of mass doesn't accelerate. Individual objects inside the system may accelerate relative to each other, but the entire system stays at rest or moves at constant velocity unless an external force acts on it. If such an external force is applied, the center of mass acceleration will be the external force divided by the system's mass.\n\n3. In a closed particle system, internal forces don't lead to any net acceleration of the system's center of mass. While objects in the system may move with respect to each other due to their interactions, these forces are always balanced.

While individual objects may accelerate relative to each other, the system as a whole maintains its overall motion. However, if an external force is applied to the system, the center of mass will accelerate according to the size of that force divided by the total mass of the system.\n\n2. For a closed system consisting of multiple particles, internal forces always come in equal and opposite pairs and don't result in any net force on the center of mass. This ensures that, although the objects within the system can move relative to each other, the center of mass itself doesn't accelerate unless some force comes from outside the system. When such an external force is present, the acceleration of the center of mass equals the external force divided by the system's total mass.\n\n3. Inside a closed system, any forces exchanged between objects are always balanced, so they can't cause the center of mass to speed up or slow down. The objects might move around each other, but the system as a whole moves steadily unless an external force acts. When that happens, the whole system's center of mass accelerates in proportion to the applied force and inversely with its total mass.\n\n4. In summary, for particles within a closed system, forces that occur internally cancel out and do not accelerate the system’s center of mass.

The following year, Noble received the rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer, and the main company became American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

Another core tactic was the feigned retreat, where they would pretend to flee, tricking enemy troops into breaking formation and chasing them, only to ambush and counterattack the now isolated groups.\n\n2. Siege warfare was another area where the Mongol military thrived—they crippled cities by redirecting rivers to cut off supplies, forced captive prisoners to march ahead of their armies, and incorporated new siege tactics and tools from those they defeated, especially using Muslim and Chinese siege engineers to support their cavalry in taking cities. The Mongols frequently relied on the tactic of pretending to retreat, which fooled enemy forces into pursuing them, only for the Mongols to turn and launch a counterattack against the separated and vulnerable enemies.\n\n3. The Mongols were highly effective in siege battles, often depriving their targets of resources by rerouting rivers, pushing prisoners before their advancing troops, and learning the latest siege techniques from conquered people, such as the Muslim and Chinese specialists who constructed siege equipment for them. A hallmark of their military method was the fake withdrawal—by apparently retreating, they tempted segments of the enemy into a chase, making them easy prey for a sudden Mongol ambush.\n\n4.

Additionally, they frequently used a deceptive tactic known as a feigned retreat, tricking enemy troops into leaving their defensive positions and splitting into smaller, more vulnerable groups, which could then be ambushed and destroyed.\n\n2.  \nSiege tactics were a hallmark of Mongol military prowess. They would sever supply lines to cities by altering river courses, use enemy captives as human shields, and constantly incorporated new weapons and techniques from subjugated populations—relying especially on the skills of Muslim and Chinese engineers to provide siege weaponry. One commonly used strategy involved pretending to flee, encouraging the opposing army to break ranks and leave safety, whereupon they could be ambushed by the waiting Mongol forces.\n\n3.  \nSuccess in siege warfare was a key feature of the Mongol military.

Alternatively, the Chinese character *Zhèng* (正), meaning \"right,\" \"just,\" or \"true,\" might have been adopted into Mongolian with the adjective suffix \"-s\" to form \"Jenggis,\" which would be rendered \"Genghis\" in old European spellings. Most likely, the 13th-century Mongolian way of saying the name was very similar to \"Chinggis.\"\n\nThere is a theory that Genghis Khan's name originates from the palatalized Mongolian and Turkic word *tenggis*, meaning \"ocean,\" \"oceanic,\" or \"vast.\" The Mongols used this word for Lake Baikal and the sea.

Yet, if this were the case, the leader would likely have been called \"Tenggis Khan,\" but this was never recorded. Another theory links the name to the Chinese word *Zhèng* (正), signifying \"right,\" \"just,\" or \"true.\" With the addition of the Mongolian adjectival ending -s, this would yield \"Jenggis,\" written in early romanizations as \"Genghis.\" The way Mongolians pronounced the name in the 13th century was probably very close to \"Chinggis.\"",

The way Mongolians in the 1200s pronounced it was probably something close to \"Chinggis.\"\n\n2.  \nAccording to one theory, the name Genghis Khan comes from a modified version of the Mongolian and Turkic word *tenggis*, which means \"ocean\" or \"wide-spreading.\" The word \"tenggis\" referred to large bodies of water like Lake Baikal or the ocean in Mongol usage. Yet, if that were the case, Genghis Khan's name should have been \"Tenggis Khan,\" which wasn't used. Another possible origin traces back to the Chinese word *Zhèng* (正), signifying \"just,\" \"true,\" or \"right,\" combined with the Mongolian modifier \"-s\" to make \"Jenggis.\" In medieval Romanized form, this became \"Genghis,\" and in the 13th century, Mongols likely said \"Chinggis.\"\n\n3.  \nSome believe Genghis Khan’s name may derive from a palatalized form of the word *tenggis* used in Mongolian and Turkic for \"ocean\" or \"vast.\" Historically, the Mongols called large bodies of water \"tenggis,\" but if that word were intended as his title, it would have been \"Tenggis Khan,\" which wasn’t the case. Alternatively, the name could come from the Chinese \"Zhèng\" (正), meaning \"right,\" \"just,\" or \"true,\" which when given the Mongolian suffix \"-s,\" becomes \"Jenggis,\" rendered as \"Genghis\" in medieval Romanized script. The original Mongolian pronunciation in the 1200s was likely \"Chinggis.\"\n\n4.  \nThe name \"Genghis Khan\" may originate from the Mongolian and Turkic word *tenggis*, which means \"ocean\" or \"wide.\" This word was used by Mongols for Lake Baikal and the sea. However, the name \"Tenggis Khan\" does not appear in historical sources. Another theory links the name to the Chinese word \"Zhèng\" (正), meaning \"correct\" or \"true,\" with the Mongolian suffix \"-s\" making it \"Jenggis,\" from which \"Genghis\" derives in older Romanizations. Pronunciation in the 13th-century Mongolian language would likely have been \"Chinggis.\""

This was followed by films like The Clouded Yellow (1951) and Payroll (1961), which showcased more of the city on screen. Notably, the 1971 classic Get Carter was filmed on location around Newcastle, providing a glimpse of the city in the late 1960s and early '70s.

    "title": "Chloroplast",
    "context": "Recently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of genetically modified crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.",

      {
        "question": "What are plants with plastid gene transformations called?",
        "answer": "transplastomic"
      }
    ],
    "completions": [
      "1.  \nChloroplasts have recently drawn the interest of scientists working on genetically modified crops. In most flowering plants, chloroplasts are maternally inherited, so any transgenes they carry are not spread via pollen. As a result, using plastid transformation provides a way to create genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, greatly minimizing potential environmental risks. This strategy of containment could help standard and organic farming to coexist more effectively. Although this approach hasn’t been thoroughly evaluated across all crop species, encouraging data from tobacco plants show that containment failure for transplastomic lines is only 3 per 1,000,000.\n\n2.  \nDevelopers of genetically engineered crops have recently focused on chloroplasts. Because chloroplasts in most flowering plants are not passed on through the male parent, any genetic modifications in these organelles cannot be transferred by pollen. This characteristic makes altering plastids a powerful approach for creating genetically modified plants that remain environmentally contained. Such biological containment can support the simultaneous existence of traditional and organic farming. Although not all crop types have been assessed, recent research with tobacco suggests a very low failure rate in containment, at just 3 out of every 1,000,000 transgenic plants.\n\n3.  \nChloroplasts have come under the spotlight for use in genetic engineering of crops. One key reason is that, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts aren’t inherited from the male side, which prevents modified genes in chloroplasts from spreading via pollen. This makes chloroplast (plastid) transformation a promising way to create genetically modified plants that are contained and pose fewer environmental threats. Consequently, this method is considered ideal for helping conventional and organic agriculture coexist. Though not fully studied in all crop species, new findings in tobacco plants show the containment system has a failure rate as low as 3 in 1,000,000.\n\n4.  \nRecently, there has been increased interest among developers of genetically modified crops in the use of chloroplasts. Since most flowering plants pass on chloroplasts only from the female parent, any genes added to these organelles will not be spread by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a potent tool for generating genetically modified plants with strong biological containment, thereby reducing environmental concerns. This approach is suitable for maintaining both conventional and organic farming practices alongside each other.

This makes transforming plastids a useful method for producing genetically modified plants with limited environmental risk, as they are biologically contained. Such containment could help conventional and organic farming coexist. Although this approach hasn’t been verified in all crops yet, studies in tobacco plants have shown a very low failure rate—only three out of one million transplastomic plants escaped containment.\n\n2.  \nRecently, scientists interested in genetically modified crops have turned their attention to chloroplasts. Because most flowering plants inherit chloroplasts solely from the mother, genes inserted into chloroplast DNA are not passed along by pollen. This characteristic makes plastid transformation an important technique for safely developing genetically engineered plants that remain contained, reducing possible environmental hazards. This method could also help organic and conventional farming exist side by side. Although not all crop species have been tested yet, experiments with tobacco plants have yielded encouraging results, with only 3 in 1,000,000 transplastomic plants breaching containment.\n\n3.  \nChloroplasts are currently gaining interest among those modifying crops genetically. In most flowering species, chloroplasts come only from the female parent, so any new genes added to them aren’t carried in pollen. This feature makes plastid transformation valuable for creating genetically modified plants that are less likely to affect the environment, as they are contained within the plant. Using this strategy may help maintain a balance between conventional and organic farming. While research on a wide range of crops is still underway, recent data from tobacco plants reveal a biological containment failure in just 3 out of 1,000,000 modified plants.\n\n4.  \nDevelopers of genetically modified plants have recently started focusing on chloroplasts. In the majority of flowering plants, chloroplasts are passed down maternally, preventing the transfer of introduced genes through pollen. This makes transforming plastids an effective approach to producing GM plants that are unlikely to spread modified genes into the wild, reducing ecological risks. As a safety measure, this technique is promising for supporting both traditional and organic farming practices. Although more studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in all crops, evidence from tobacco plants shows a containment breach occurring only 3 times within a million modified specimens.",
      "Chloroplasts have recently become a focus for genetic engineers working on modified crops. In most flowering plants, chloroplasts are inherited only from the mother, so genes placed in these organelles are not spread through pollen. As a result, transforming the plastids is an effective way to develop genetically modified plants that are unlikely to cross-contaminate surrounding plants, thus reducing environmental hazards. This method of containment is useful for ensuring that traditional and organic farming can occur alongside GM crops. Although this approach hasn’t been examined fully in every crop, studies in tobacco have shown a very low escape rate, about 3 in 1,000,000 transplastomic plants.\n\nScientists working with GM crops have turned their attention to chloroplasts. Since, for most flowering plants, chloroplasts are only passed down from the female, any genetic modifications within them are not transmitted through pollen. This containment ability means plastid transformation could be key in producing GM plants with minimal risk of gene escape, helping to maintain boundaries between GM, traditional, and organic agriculture. Though this technique has not been tested in all crops, encouraging tobacco studies indicate just 3 out of 1,000,000 plants failed to contain the modified genes.\n\nThe development of genetically modified crops has shone a spotlight on chloroplasts. Because, in the majority of flowering plants, chloroplasts come solely from the female, transferred genes within them cannot be spread by pollen. This provides a safe biological barrier, making plastid transformation valuable for creating GM plants that don’t threaten their environment. This method of limiting gene flow makes it easier for different types of agriculture to coexist. While this containment hasn’t been fully validated for every crop, preliminary results in tobacco have been positive, with gene containment succeeding in all but 3 out of every 1,000,000 cases.",

With these electrons, certain proteins pump H+ ions into the thylakoid space, leading to a sharp buildup of hydrogen ions inside. When the ions flow out through ATP synthase, the enzyme captures their energy and synthesizes ATP from ADP. The ATP synthase faces out into the stroma, allowing the newly formed ATP to be directly available for the plant’s dark (Calvin cycle) reactions.\n\n4.  \nLike mitochondria, chloroplasts rely on a hydrogen ion (H+) gradient to make ATP. After light energy excites electrons in water, the electrons are transferred via two photosystems and an electron transport chain. The energy from these electrons is used to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid, creating a large concentration gradient. Hydrogen ions then move back into the stroma through ATP synthase, which uses their energy to join a phosphate to ADP, forming ATP. Because ATP synthase is located so that its active site faces the stroma, ATP production takes place there, conveniently close to where it will be needed in later reactions."

The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The word \"Imperialism\" was adopted into modern English during the late 1870s by critics accusing British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli of forceful and flashy imperial policies. Soon, advocates like Joseph Chamberlain began using the term in support of such expansion. Interpretations have varied, with some viewing imperialism as an altruistic or idealistic endeavor, while others see it driven by national self-interest or capitalist ambition. Liberal thinker John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin gave the concept a broader economic meaning, particularly Lenin, who argued that imperialism was an inevitable outcome of capitalism’s need for continual growth, resources, and investment, resulting in colonial expansion. Later Marxist writers continued to stress this structural view, and the concept of imperialism came to refer to a longstanding global system rather than a specific policy or period. This expanded usage often traces imperialism back to Columbus’s voyages or even the Crusades. As its meaning has broadened, imperialism is now discussed through moral, economic, systemic, cultural, and temporal perspectives—mirroring growing discomfort with the reality of Western dominance.\n\n2.  \nTheories of imperialism in anglophone academia commonly focus on Britain’s imperial history.

To some, imperialism was an idealistic and philanthropic venture, but critics increasingly linked it to self-serving politics and capitalist exploitation. Thinkers such as Hobson and Lenin gave the term a more macroeconomic and theoretical dimension. Lenin, in his influential book, argued that imperialism is the natural extension of capitalism’s relentless expansionist needs, necessitating colonialism. This systemic interpretation has been echoed by subsequent Marxists, who further broadened the concept. Today, imperialism is often seen as a centuries-spanning global system, not just a late-19th-century British policy, with its meaning stretching across moral, economic, structural, cultural, and historical lines—reflecting the growing discomfort with Western power structures.\n\n3.  \nImperialism, as studied in English-speaking academic circles, frequently draws on Britain’s colonial legacy. The concept entered the English language in its current sense in the late 1870s, largely as a criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli’s aggressive imperial actions. It was soon adopted by advocates of imperialism as well, such as Joseph Chamberlain. Initially, imperialism was painted either as a lofty, philanthropic idea or condemned for its selfish motives and capitalist greed. Theorists like Hobson and Lenin introduced key economic critiques, with Lenin famously framing imperialism as a consequence of capitalism’s perpetual need for new resources and markets, a stance that influenced generations of Marxists. Over time, the concept grew to encompass not a mere historical moment, but a centuries-long global system—some even trace its origins to the age of Columbus or the Crusades.

The word “imperialism” came into common English usage in the late 19th century, initially used by critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli’s assertive and conspicuous imperial agenda. However, it was soon adopted by proponents like Joseph Chamberlain. Some viewed imperialism as motivated by ideals and altruism, while others saw it as a manifestation of political self-interest or, increasingly, as driven by capitalist aims. The liberal thinker John A. Hobson and the Marxist Vladimir Lenin gave the term a broader theoretical and economic meaning. Lenin, especially through his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, profoundly shaped later Marxist interpretations, arguing that imperialism was a fundamental aspect of capitalism, driven by the need to expand investments, resources, and labor, which led to colonial domination. Subsequent Marxist writers have echoed this view, highlighting imperialism’s structural nature. Leftist scholars have since broadened the concept to cover not just policies or specific eras, but a global system spanning centuries, sometimes reaching as far back as Columbus or even the Crusades.

The term itself was popularized in the late 1870s, initially as a critique of Prime Minister Disraeli’s forceful imperialism before being embraced by advocates like Chamberlain. For some, imperialism reflected noble intentions or philanthropy, while others accused it of serving political ambition or capitalist desire. Thinkers like Hobson and Lenin deepened the concept, linking it to broad economic theories. Lenin’s influential analysis depicted imperialism as an inevitable outgrowth of capitalism, requiring constant economic expansion and leading to colonial pursuits. Modern Marxists have built on this idea, casting imperialism as an enduring structural feature. Over time, academics have stretched the definition to describe centuries-old global systems, dating as far back as European explorations and even medieval Crusades. This broader application has led to a shifting definition across moral, economic, systemic, cultural, and chronological axes, mirroring an increasing apprehension about the existence and exercise of Western dominance.\n\n3.  \nImperialism, as discussed in English academic circles, typically draws on Britain’s history. The term entered popular English use in the late 1800s, especially as critics accused Disraeli’s government of practicing a particularly flamboyant form of imperial expansion. Supporters, such as Chamberlain, soon reclaimed the label. People have debated whether imperialism is motivated by high ideals and charity, or by the pursuit of political advantage and capitalist profits. Writers like Hobson and especially Lenin gave the concept a more systemic and economic focus, with Lenin describing imperialism in his work as an inevitable stage of capitalism forced by the relentless need for growth—spurring colonialism. Later Marxists reinforced this structural interpretation. Scholars have since widened the scope of imperialism to encompass world systems lasting centuries, broadening its coverage and altering its meaning in several directions: moral, economic, systemic, cultural, and historical.

The motivations ascribed to imperialism have ranged from idealistic and philanthropic to politically and economically self-interested, increasingly seen in terms of capitalist exploitation. Hobson, a liberal, and Lenin, a Marxist, notably reframed imperialism as a macroeconomic phenomenon, with Lenin’s analysis presenting it as an inherent stage in capitalist development requiring ongoing expansion and colonization. Later Marxists have maintained this depiction of imperialism as a core feature of capitalism.

      "1.  \nThe origin of the term “Huguenot” is uncertain and was originally used as a mocking label. Researchers have offered different theories, one of which connects the word to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (d. 1532) and the complex religious politics of Swiss republicanism. The term may be a play on Hugues’ name, combined with the Dutch \"Huisgenoten\" (meaning “housemates”), and the German \"Eidgenosse\" (a term for members of the Swiss Confederacy). Geneva, known as John Calvin’s center of activity, was Hugues’ city, where he led a party favoring alliance with the Swiss Confederation for independence from the Duke of Savoy. In France, the label Huguenot was said to have first been applied to members of the Reformed Church involved in the failed Amboise conspiracy of 1560 against the House of Guise. The name thus came to associate French Protestants with unpopular foreign politics.\n\n2.  \n“Huguenot” was initially a term of ridicule whose exact origin remains a mystery, though several explanations have been given. One theory ties the term to Besançon Hugues, a Catholic leader in Geneva, and references to Dutch and German words meaning “housemates” and “confederates.” Hugues led the “Confederate Party,” pushing for Geneva’s independence via alliance with the Swiss Confederation, during the time that Geneva served as the hub of Calvinism. The name “Huguenot” supposedly first appeared in France to describe noble Protestant conspirators involved in the Amboise plot of 1560, who sought to shift power away from the House of Guise and perhaps further relations with Switzerland. The name thereby evolved as a combination of political and religious connotations unfamiliar or unwelcome in France.\n\n3.  \nOriginally meant to mock, the word \"Huguenot\" has a debated history. Some believe it originated as a pun mixing the name of Besançon Hugues, a Geneva politician, with the Dutch word \"Huisgenoten\" (\"housemates\") and the German \"Eidgenosse\" (\"confederate”). During Hugues’ time, Geneva—Calvin’s chosen city—was a focal point for religious and political struggles, including Hugues’ own push for independence from Savoy through a Swiss alliance. In France, “Huguenot” reportedly initially referred to Protestant nobles involved in the 1560 Amboise plot against the ruling House of Guise, marking them with a name linked to both foreign politics and the Protestant Reformation.",
      "1.  \nHuguenot was initially a mocking term whose exact origins are still debated. Some theories suggest it referenced the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues and the divided religious scene of Swiss republicanism, playing on his name with the Dutch word Huisgenoten (\"housemates\") and the German Eidgenosse (\"Confederates\"). In Geneva—home to John Calvin—Hugues, a Catholic, led the \"Confederate Party,\" which pushed for Geneva’s independence from the Duke of Savoy in alliance with the Swiss Confederation. The term Huguenot reportedly first described the French aristocratic Protestants involved in the failed Amboise plot of 1560, an attempt to undermine the powerful House of Guise, which also aimed to strengthen ties with the Swiss. In this way, Hugues plus Eidgenosse, via Huisgenoten, evolved into Huguenot—a label connecting Protestantism with political ideas unpopular in France.\n\n2.  \nThe word \"Huguenot\" began as a mocking nickname whose origins aren't fully clear. One popular explanation ties the name to Besançon Hugues, a Swiss politician associated with Geneva, and connects the term to the Dutch and German words for “confederate” and “housemates.” Hugues, although Catholic, was a prominent member of the “Confederate Party” in Geneva, which advocated for an alliance with the Swiss Confederation against the Duke of Savoy. The label was reportedly first used in France to describe Protestant aristocrats involved in the failed 1560 Amboise plot to challenge the powerful House of Guise—a plan also intended to strengthen relations with the Swiss. Thus, \"Huguenot\" supposedly emerged as a play on these words and people, symbolizing French Protestantism as politically suspicious.\n\n3.  \nOriginally intended as an insult, \"Huguenot\" has uncertain origins, though various theories exist. One suggests it combines references to Swiss figure Besançon Hugues, the political divisions in Swiss republicanism, and linguistic plays on the Dutch \"Huisgenoten\" (housemates) and German \"Eidgenosse\" (confederate). Geneva, at that time Calvin’s stronghold, was where Hugues—a Catholic—led the so-called “Confederate Party,” promoting Geneva’s independence with Swiss support. French Protestants in the failed 1560 Amboise plot against the House of Guise were the first to be called Huguenots, with the term connecting their cause to policies viewed unfavorably in France by tying it to Swiss political ideas.\n\n4.  \nThe term \"Huguenot\" started as a term of ridicule with mysterious roots. Several possibilities have been suggested, including connections to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues and a wordplay involving the Dutch term \"Huisgenoten\" (housemates) and the German word \"Eidgenosse\" (confederate). Geneva, where John Calvin led the Reformation, was the home of Hugues, who led a pro-Swiss independence party despite being Catholic. The nickname \"Huguenot\" was allegedly first given to French Protestant nobles involved in the unsuccessful Amboise plot of 1560, a conspiracy meant to shift power away from the House of Guise and forge closer links with the Swiss. The name thus brought together Hugues, Eidgenosse, and Huisgenoten, linking Protestantism with Swiss political aims disliked in France.",

Several theories have been suggested. One idea links the nickname to Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and to the complex religious situation in Swiss republicanism, playing on Hugues’s name and the Dutch word “Huisgenoten” (meaning housemates), as well as the German \"Eidgenosse\" (which translates as confederate). John Calvin made Geneva—a city closely tied to these political and religious tensions—the heart of the Calvinist movement. Although Hugues was Catholic, he led the “Confederate Party,” which aimed for Geneva’s independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance with the Swiss Confederation. The French application of the term “Huguenot” apparently began with aristocratic Protestants involved in the 1560 Amboise plot, an unsuccessful bid to reduce the power of the House of Guise, which would also have strengthened Swiss connections. Thus, “Hugues” and “Eidgenosse,” by way of the Dutch “Huisgenoten,” allegedly became “Huguenot,” a term connecting Protestantism to political dissent in France.\n\n2.  \nOriginally a term of mockery, “Huguenot” has mysterious beginnings. Among proposed explanations is a combination of references: to Swiss leader Besançon Hugues and to the Dutch word “Huisgenoten” (housemates), itself connected to the German term “Eidgenosse” (confederate). Geneva, where John Calvin established his base, was at the center of these influences. Hugues, a Catholic, headed the “Confederate Party” in Geneva, which sought autonomy from the Duke of Savoy by aligning with the Swiss confederation. In France, the “Huguenot” label was first given to Reformed Church nobles who conspired in the failed Amboise plot of 1560, aiming to break the power of the House of Guise and encourage Swiss ties. Thus, the word “Huguenot” likely originated from a blend of political and linguistic factors linking Protestants to unpopular politics in France.\n\n3.  \nThe word “Huguenot” was at first a mocking nickname with obscure roots. Some believe it originated from Besançon Hugues, a notable Swiss political figure, mixed with the Dutch word “Huisgenoten” (which means housemates) and the German “Eidgenosse” (meaning confederate). Geneva, where John Calvin made his home and led the Calvinist movement, was deeply involved in these politics. Hugues, though a Catholic, led a party advocating Geneva’s independence from the Duke of Savoy by allying with the Swiss. The term “Huguenot” was first used in France for members of the Amboise plot in 1560, mostly Reformed Church nobles attempting to challenge the powerful House of Guise. This also would have helped their relationship with the Swiss. Therefore, the term “Huguenot” apparently combines these cultural influences, linking it to Protestant ideas and political movements considered controversial in France.\n\n4.  \n“Huguenot” began as a derogatory term, and its origins are debated. Some theories suggest it combined the name of Swiss politician Besançon Hugues with the Dutch word “Huisgenoten” (housemates) and the German “Eidgenosse” (confederate). Geneva, Calvin’s stronghold, was central to these associations. Hugues led a pro-independence party, seeking Geneva’s freedom from the Duke of Savoy by joining with the Swiss. The term surfaced in France during the Amboise plot of 1560, used to label Protestant aristocrats opposing the House of Guise. Thus, “Huguenot” may have arisen as a compound term linking the Protestant movement with political opposition to the French establishment.",

The theory goes that the name blends Hugues, Eidgenosse, and Huisgenoten, linking the Protestant movement to unpopular politics.\n\n2.  \nOriginally meant as an insult, \"Huguenot\" is a term with mysterious beginnings. One popular idea is that it combines a reference to Besançon Hugues, a leader in Geneva with complex political and religious associations, with words from Dutch (\"Huisgenoten\" for housemates) and German (\"Eidgenosse\" for confederate). Geneva, where Calvinism flourished under John Calvin, was the stage for Hugues’s leadership in the pro-independence \"Confederate Party.\" The label \"Huguenot\" was allegedly first attached to French Protestant nobles involved in the failed 1560 Amboise coup against the Catholic House of Guise—an event that would have deepened French-Swiss relations.

Some believe it refers to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues and includes a pun from the Dutch \"Huisgenoten,\" meaning \"housemates,\" and the German \"Eidgenosse,\" or \"Confederate.\" This ties back to Geneva, John Calvin’s center of reform, where Hugues led a Catholic group supporting independence from Savoy through alliance with Switzerland. The term reportedly surfaced in France during the 1560 Amboise plot, a failed effort by Protestant nobles to challenge the powerful House of Guise. The term \"Huguenot\" thus allegedly combines aspects of Hugues’s name and the concepts of alliance and confederacy, connecting French Protestants to controversial politics.\n\n4.  \nThe word \"Huguenot,\" first used as a slur, has ambiguous origins with various explanations. One suggests it emerged from linking the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues’s name to the Dutch \"Huisgenoten\" (housemates) and the German \"Eidgenosse\" (confederate), referencing political alliances in Geneva, a major Protestant hub under John Calvin. Hugues, despite being Catholic, led Geneva’s \"Confederate Party\" to secure independence from Savoy through Swiss partnership. In France, the term was supposedly coined for the elite Protestants of the failed 1560 Amboise plot against the House of Guise, associating them with Swiss politics disliked in France.

Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nThe term \"Huguenot\" was originally used as an insult, and its exact beginnings are uncertain. One theory links it to Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532), suggesting the name combined his surname with Dutch \"Huisgenoten\" (meaning “housemates”) and the German \"Eidgenosse\" (referring to a member of the Swiss Confederacy). During this period, Geneva—Calvin’s base and a hub for Calvinism—was led in part by Hugues, a Catholic who supported independence from the Duke of Savoy by aligning Geneva with the Swiss Confederation. The name \"Huguenot\" is said to have first referred to a group of French aristocrats, all members of the Reformed Church, who plotted the 1560 Amboise coup against the House of Guise. The nickname thus linked Protestant sympathizers in France with Swiss political movements considered contentious there.\n\n2.  \n\"Huguenot\" started out as a mocking label, and the story behind the word is murky. Some suggest it derives from Besançon Hugues, a Swiss figure from Geneva, interwoven with the Dutch word \"Huisgenoten\" (“housemates”) and the German \"Eidgenosse\" (“confederate”). Geneva, John Calvin’s center of reform, had Hugues—a Catholic—leading the pro-independence “Confederate Party.” This party sought Geneva’s freedom from the Duke of Savoy via ties to the Swiss Confederacy. The term “Huguenot” was supposedly first applied in France to aristocratic Calvinists involved in the failed 1560 Amboise plot to overthrow the House of Guise and strengthen Swiss ties.

One explanation points to a pun involving Besançon Hugues, a key Geneva politician, and the words “Huisgenoten” (Dutch for housemates) and “Eidgenosse” (German for confederate). Geneva, home to John Calvin, was led by Hugues (though he was Catholic) who spearheaded a party seeking to break from Savoy with Swiss Confederacy support. The word “Huguenot” reportedly became popular in France after being used for a group of Reformed Church nobles involved in the unsuccessful 1560 Amboise conspiracy against the House of Guise. The name then became shorthand for French Protestants associated with controversial Swiss-inspired politics.\n\n4.  \nThe word \"Huguenot\" began as a term of contempt, its origin shrouded in mystery. Some theories link it to Besançon Hugues, a Geneva statesman, playing on his name and the Dutch “Huisgenoten” (\"housemates\") along with the German “Eidgenosse” (“confederate of the Swiss”). During Hugues’ time, Geneva was Calvin’s stronghold and a center of religious change. Hugues, despite being Catholic, was a leader in the movement for Geneva’s autonomy from Savoy, allying with Swiss states. In France, “Huguenot” was apparently first used for aristocratic Protestants implicated in the failed Amboise plot of 1560 against the Guise family.

He kept improving the translation right up until he died. Although others had previously translated the Bible into German, Luther shaped his version according to his doctrinal beliefs. When people criticized him for adding the word \"alone\" to Romans 3:28 after \"faith,\" Luther defended his choice by arguing that the context and Paul’s meaning demanded it, since Paul was emphasizing that salvation comes through faith in Christ, not through works.

Luther continuously revised his translation until his death. Unlike earlier versions, Luther's translation reflected his own doctrinal views. He was criticized for adding \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, but responded that the passage required it, as it dealt directly with the principle of justification by faith in Christ alone, apart from works. Accordingly, Luther believed the only way to be clear was to state, “We are justified by faith alone, not by works.”\n\n3.  \nMartin Luther's translation of the New Testament into German was published in 1522, and he, with help from others, completed the Old Testament by 1534, resulting in the publication of the full Bible.

When accused of inserting \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, Luther contended that St. Paul's teaching on justification by faith necessitated the addition. He argued that, since the passage intends to exclude the role of works, truthfully expressing it means saying, “Faith alone justifies, not works.”",

He devoted the rest of his life to perfecting this translation. While earlier German translations existed, Luther's version reflected his own religious views. When he was accused of adding the word \"alone\" to Romans 3:28 after \"faith,\" he defended this choice, arguing that Paul’s intent was to show that believers are made righteous through faith in Christ and not by works. He explained that if works are excluded, it must be by faith alone that one is justified, so expressing it this way clarifies the doctrine.\n\n---\n\nIn 1522, Martin Luther published a German translation of the New Testament, later completing the Old Testament in 1534, thus making the full Bible accessible. He continually revised his translation until he died. Although German translations already existed, Luther’s version aligned with his doctrinal beliefs. Critics objected when he inserted \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, but Luther maintained that this accurately represented Paul's message—that justification comes solely through faith in Christ, not through any works—so he felt compelled to state, \"Faith alone justifies us, and not works.\"\n\n---\n\nMartin Luther's German New Testament appeared in 1522; by 1534, he and his team finished translating the Old Testament, producing the full Bible in German.

When challenged about his addition of the word \"alone\" to the phrase \"by faith\" in Romans 3:28, Luther argued that this was necessary to clearly convey Paul's teaching: that people are justified only by their faith in Christ and not by their deeds. He insisted that saying \"Faith alone justifies us\" was the clearest way to teach this distinction.\n\n---\n\nStarting with the New Testament in 1522, Martin Luther and his collaborators finished translating the Old Testament by 1534, making a complete German Bible. Luther continued to improve his translation for the rest of his life. While others had translated the Bible into German before him, Luther’s version was influenced by his theological outlook. Critics took issue with his addition of \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, but Luther responded that the context of Paul's writing made it necessary, emphasizing that Christians are justified by faith in Christ and not through obeying the law, and that saying \"faith alone\" communicates this clearly.",

Avogadro, in 1811, provided the accurate chemical understanding of water's makeup through his law and the hypothesis of diatomic molecules.\n\n3.  \nAt first, John Dalton’s atomic theory proposed that elements are composed of individual atoms that combine in the simplest ratios to form compounds. Dalton believed water was \"HO,\" causing him to conclude that oxygen has an atomic mass eight times greater than hydrogen. This assumption changed after Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt, in 1805, found that water is composed of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen by volume. Building on this, Amedeo Avogadro clarified in 1811 that water’s true formula is H₂O, using ideas now called Avogadro’s law and diatomic molecules.\n\n4.  \nJohn Dalton's early model of atoms suggested all elements were monatomic and combined in the simplest possible proportions, leading him to the mistaken belief that water was made of HO and that oxygen was eight times heavier than hydrogen. This was revised after Gay-Lussac and Humboldt’s experiments in 1805 showed that water is produced from two volumes of hydrogen for every one volume of oxygen. In 1811, Avogadro gave the correct explanation for water’s composition based on what we now refer to as Avogadro’s law and the hypothesis that elements like hydrogen and oxygen form diatomic molecules.",
      "1. John Dalton originally proposed that all elements are monatomic and that compounds have the simplest possible ratios between their atoms. For instance, he believed water was composed of HO, which led him to estimate oxygen’s atomic mass as eight times that of hydrogen, rather than the now-accepted value of roughly sixteen. However, in 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt demonstrated that water consists of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. By 1811, Amedeo Avogadro clarified the composition of water using what is now known as Avogadro’s law, and by assuming elements can exist as diatomic molecules.\n\n2. Dalton’s early atomic theory suggested all elements consisted of single atoms and that their combinations in compounds represented the simplest numerical relationships. He therefore thought water was made up of one hydrogen and one oxygen atom (HO), which caused him to calculate oxygen's atomic mass as eight times that of hydrogen. But in 1805, Gay-Lussac and Humboldt discovered that water actually combines two volumes of hydrogen with one of oxygen. Later, in 1811, Avogadro provided the correct understanding of water’s structure, building on Avogadro’s law and the concept of diatomic molecules.\n\n3. According to Dalton’s initial atomic hypothesis, every element existed as a single atom, and compounds formed in the most straightforward atomic proportions. Consequently, he assigned water the formula HO and considered oxygen to be eight times heavier than hydrogen, not the current value of about sixteen. This view was revised after Gay-Lussac and Humboldt’s 1805 finding that water is made from two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen. Avogadro, in 1811, used what became known as Avogadro’s law and the idea of diatomic molecules to correctly interpret water’s composition.\n\n4. Dalton's first atomic theory held that elements were monatomic and combined in the simplest ratios in compounds. Because of this, he wrongly wrote water's formula as HO, and calculated an atomic mass for oxygen eight times that of hydrogen, instead of approximately sixteen. The true proportions were found in 1805 by Gay-Lussac and Humboldt, who observed that water forms from two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Building on these experiments, Avogadro, in 1811, applied his law to correctly deduce water’s molecule contains two hydrogens and one oxygen."

      "**Version 1:**\nIn the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue led 2,000 Troupes de la Marine and indigenous allies to secure the French King’s territory in the Ohio Valley against British encroachment. Unlike Céloron, who four years earlier marked French claims only by burying lead plates, Marin built actual forts and stationed troops. His first fortification, Fort Presque Isle, was raised near modern-day Erie, Pennsylvania, followed by the construction of a road to LeBoeuf Creek's headwaters where he built Fort Le Boeuf near present-day Waterford. As Marin’s forces advanced south, they pushed out or captured British traders, causing alarm among the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson, a Mingo chief who distrusted the French due to personal grievances, confronted the French at Fort Le Boeuf and threatened retaliation, but Marin ignored these threats.\n\n**Version 2:**\nIn early 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was ordered to lead a 2,000-strong group of Troupes de la Marine and Native allies to defend France’s claims in the Ohio Valley from British intrusion. Marin took the path that Céloron had once explored, but went further by constructing forts wherever Céloron had only left lead markers. The first, Fort Presque Isle, was built on Lake Erie’s southern shore near today’s Erie, Pennsylvania. A road connected this to the newly established Fort Le Boeuf at the source of LeBoeuf Creek in what is now Waterford. Marin’s campaign forced British traders out, which worried both British interests and the Iroquois. Meanwhile, Tanaghrisson—a Mingo chief hostile to the French—arrived at Fort Le Boeuf, issuing warnings of war that Marin dismissed outright.\n\n**Version 3:**\nSpring 1753 saw Paul Marin de la Malgue take charge of a French and Indian force of 2,000, tasked with defending the Ohio Valley from British advances. Following the route charted by Céloron years earlier but taking further action, Marin oversaw the building and manning of forts, starting with Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie’s southern edge near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. He then ordered a road built to the source of LeBoeuf Creek and erected Fort Le Boeuf near what is now Waterford. As Marin’s men advanced southward, they expelled British traders, sparking concern among both the British and the local Iroquois. One leader, Tanaghrisson—a Mingo chief with deep resentment towards the French—approached the new forts and threatened an attack, which Marin scoffed at.\n\n**Version 4:**\nIn the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue led two thousand French and Native troops to safeguard the French King’s interests in the Ohio Valley from British takeover. Marin took a more aggressive approach than earlier French efforts, building and garrisoning Fort Presque Isle near modern Erie, Pennsylvania, and Fort Le Boeuf at the origins of LeBoeuf Creek near Waterford. He set up a connecting road and actively removed British traders from the region, which alarmed the British and their Iroquois allies.

This idea first came about due to William Hartnell, the original Doctor, suffering from ill health. However, the word \"regeneration\" wasn’t used until the Doctor’s third on-screen transformation; Hartnell’s version referred to it as a \"renewal,\" while the Second Doctor called it a \"change of appearance.\" This narrative device made it possible to recast the Doctor multiple times over the years and depict alternative versions from other points in the character’s timeline.\n\n2. The concept of regeneration in Doctor Who was created so the main character could be recast when needed, particularly after William Hartnell’s health declined. Although the process was initially called a \"renewal\" for Hartnell’s Doctor, and a \"change of appearance\" for his successor, the official term \"regeneration\" wasn’t introduced until the third time the Doctor changed. This clever mechanism has enabled the casting of new actors in the role and the exploration of Doctor variants from different eras.\n\n3. Producers of Doctor Who implemented regeneration as a solution for changing the actor in the lead role when necessary, originally as a result of William Hartnell’s health issues. The specific term \"regeneration\" did not appear until the Doctor’s third transformation; early versions described the process as a \"renewal\" or a simple \"change of appearance.\" This approach has let the show recast the Doctor many times, also allowing for stories with alternative Doctors from other points in the character’s chronological life.",

To allow the main actor to be replaced, Doctor Who's creators came up with the idea of regeneration. They did this when William Hartnell, the first actor to play the Doctor, became too ill to continue. The word \"regeneration\" wasn't used until the Doctor's third transition; previously, it was called a \"renewal,\" and the next time, a \"change of appearance.\" Thanks to this idea, the show's lead role has changed hands several times, and alternative Doctors from the past or future have also been portrayed.\n\n3. Regeneration was introduced in Doctor Who by the producers as a way to change the actor who plays the Doctor, especially after William Hartnell's health worsened. The initial transformations weren't called \"regeneration;\" Hartnell's was termed a \"renewal\" and his successor's as a \"change of appearance.\" This innovation has enabled numerous actors to take on the Doctor's role and allowed the show to explore different versions of the character throughout time.\n\n4. The concept of regeneration in Doctor Who was created by producers to allow the main character to be played by different actors, originally because the first actor, William Hartnell, was unwell. Early on, the process wasn't called \"regeneration\"—Hartnell’s Doctor experienced a \"renewal\" and the following Doctor had a \"change of appearance.\" This plot device has supported multiple recastings and appearances of alternate Doctors from the character's history or future.",

This narrative tool has made it possible to repeatedly recast the main role and feature alternative incarnations of the Doctor from other time periods in the series.\n\n3.  \nTo accommodate the recasting of Doctor Who’s central character—especially after William Hartnell’s health declined—producers came up with the process of regeneration. The original transformations weren't specifically named, with the First Doctor mentioning a \"renewal\" and the Second describing it as a \"change of appearance.\" It was only during the third transition that the word \"regeneration\" was coined. This creative solution has let numerous actors play the Doctor, and has allowed the show to explore different versions of the character from both the past and future.\n\n4.  \nFaced with William Hartnell’s failing health, the Doctor Who team devised regeneration to seamlessly introduce new actors into the lead role.

At first, the process wasn't called \"regeneration\" — Hartnell's Doctor referred to it as a \"renewal,\" while the Second Doctor called it a \"change of appearance.\"[citation needed] The concept has made it possible to recast the Doctor multiple times, and to feature different incarnations of the character from various points in their timeline.[citation needed]\n\n2. In order to allow for a new actor to take on the lead role, Doctor Who's producers came up with the storyline of regeneration. This arose when William Hartnell, the original actor, became too unwell to continue. The word \"regeneration\" was only used from the Doctor's third transformation; earlier, the event was called \"renewal\" by the First Doctor and a \"change of appearance\" by the Second Doctor.[citation needed] Thanks to this narrative device, the Doctor has been played by many different actors and even shown in various forms across alternate timelines.[citation needed]\n\n3. Regeneration was a creative solution developed by the Doctor Who team to replace the main character without disrupting the storyline. This was necessary due to the initial actor, William Hartnell, suffering from poor health. Notably, the specific term \"regeneration\" was not used until the Doctor's third change; Hartnell's version referred to a \"renewal,\" and his successor's transformation was called a \"change of appearance.\"[citation needed] This storytelling method has enabled numerous actors to portray the Doctor, as well as the portrayal of alternate versions of the character from different time periods.[citation needed]",
      "1.  \nThe idea of regeneration was introduced by Doctor Who producers to allow for the main character to be recast with a different actor. This idea arose when William Hartnell, the original actor, experienced health issues. Initially, the process wasn’t called “regeneration”—Hartnell’s transformation was described as a “renewal,” and the Second Doctor’s as a “change of appearance.” The term \"regeneration\" only appeared with the Doctor’s third on-screen change. This narrative device has enabled multiple recastings of the Doctor across the series, and has also been used to portray other versions of the Doctor from different points in time.\n\n2.  \nTo accommodate changes in cast, Doctor Who producers established the concept of regeneration, prompted initially by William Hartnell’s declining health. At first, the main character’s transformation was referred to as a “renewal,” with the following Doctor’s shift termed a “change of appearance.” The word \"regeneration\" was not actually used until the Doctor changed for the third time on screen. Thanks to this plot element, the show has reimagined its lead role several times and showcased different incarnations of the Doctor from various temporal perspectives.\n\n3.  \nRegeneration became a part of Doctor Who lore as a way to switch actors playing the leading role, particularly when William Hartnell grew too ill to continue. Early on, these transitions were called a “renewal” or a “change of appearance,” with “regeneration” being mentioned only from the third such event onwards. This narrative tool has permitted the Doctor to have multiple faces over the decades, and it has facilitated stories featuring other versions of the Doctor, originating from both past and future timelines.\n\n4.  \nDoctor Who’s producers created the notion of regeneration to solve the issue of recasting the central character, especially after original actor William Hartnell’s health became a problem. Initially, the process wasn’t called “regeneration”—terms like “renewal” or “change of appearance” were used instead. The name “regeneration” emerged during the Doctor’s third on-screen transformation. This inventive device has since made it possible to cast new actors as the Doctor multiple times and to introduce alternative versions of the character from different temporal points."

      "Sure! Here are a few rewritten versions of the given passage:\n\n1.  \nWhen we set an upper limit on computation time using a specific function f(n), the resulting complexity classes can vary based on the type of machine employed. For example, the language {xx | x is any binary string} is computable in linear time with a multi-tape Turing machine, but needs quadratic time with a single-tape Turing machine. According to the Cobham-Edmonds thesis, as long as we permit polynomial differences in execution time, \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This principle gives rise to the complexity class P, composed of decision problems that a deterministic Turing machine can solve in polynomial time. The analogous class for function problems is called FP.\n\n2.  \nImposing a concrete upper bound like f(n) on computation time often leads to complexity classes that are influenced by the computational model chosen. For instance, consider the language consisting of all strings of the form xx, where x is a binary string: this can be handled in linear time by a multi-tape Turing machine but requires quadratic time if only a single-tape Turing machine is available. If polynomial differences in time are tolerated, the Cobham-Edmonds thesis assures us that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2).

      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage you provided:\n\n1.  \nIn computational complexity theory, setting an upper limit on computation time using a specific function f(n) often creates complexity classes that vary based on the type of machine used. For example, the language made up of all strings where a binary string is repeated twice ({xx | x is any binary string}) can be decided in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but would take quadratic time on a single-tape Turing machine. However, if we accept polynomial differences in running times, the Cobham-Edmonds thesis tells us that any two reasonable and broad computational models will have time complexities that are related by a polynomial (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This concept underlies the complexity class P, which consists of all decision problems that a deterministic Turing machine can solve in polynomial time. The set of analogous function problems is called FP.\n\n2.  \nAccording to computational complexity theory, when you limit computation time with a specific function f(n), the resulting complexity classes are often determined by the computational model being used. For instance, a multi-tape Turing machine can solve the language {xx | x is any binary string} in linear time, while a single-tape Turing machine needs quadratic time. The Cobham-Edmonds thesis allows polynomial flexibility in runtime, stating that the time complexities between any two reasonable computational models are related by a polynomial factor (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This principle establishes the complexity class P, which contains all problems a deterministic Turing machine can solve within polynomial time. The class FP is the corresponding set for function problems.\n\n3.  \nIn the field of computational complexity theory, placing an upper bound on the required computation time via a function f(n) often creates complexity classes that are specific to the chosen computational model. For example, the task of recognizing strings of the form xx (where x is any binary string) can be accomplished in linear time with a multi-tape Turing machine but needs quadratic time with a single-tape Turing machine. However, if differences in running time up to a polynomial are allowed, the Cobham-Edmonds thesis claims that, for any reasonable and general models, their running times are polynomially related (see Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This grounds the complexity class P, consisting of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, and its functional counterpart, FP.\n\n4.  \nComputational complexity theory explores how putting an upper limit—specified by a function f(n)—on computation time often leads to complexity classes that rely on the machine model chosen. For example, the language of all binary strings of the form xx is solvable in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but requires quadratic time on a single-tape Turing machine. The Cobham-Edmonds thesis, which allows for polynomial differences in run time, asserts that the time complexities across any two reasonable and comprehensive models are related by a polynomial (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2).

This process, known as cyclic photophosphorylation, involves the recycling of electrons. Cyclic photophosphorylation is especially prevalent in C4 plants, which have a greater demand for ATP compared to NADPH.\n\n2.

Within the chloroplast, photosystem II breaks apart water to supply and energize fresh electrons; in contrast, photosystem I re-energizes electrons that have already traveled through the electron transport chain. Ordinarily, NADP+ captures these high-energy electrons. However, on occasion, the electrons cycle back, powering further hydrogen ion pumping across the thylakoid membrane to make more ATP. This recycling is known as cyclic photophosphorylation, a process particularly prevalent in C4 plants that have higher ATP needs compared to NADPH.\n\n3. The chloroplast uses photosystem II to split water molecules, obtaining new electrons that are then energized, whereas photosystem I serves to re-energize electrons at the end of the electron transport chain.

      "1.  \nWilliam III of Orange, who would go on to be King of England, became the main adversary of King Louis XIV when France invaded the Dutch Republic in 1672.

There, they also discovered numerous French-speaking Calvinist churches.\n\n2.  \nAfter the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672, Stadtholder William III of Orange, later King of England, arose as Louis XIV’s most formidable foe. He organized the League of Augsburg, a coalition aimed at counteracting the power of Louis and France.

They found plenty of French-language Calvinist churches there as well.\n\n3.  \nThe Dutch Republic was invaded by France in 1672, prompting Stadtholder William III of Orange, who would eventually become England’s king, to emerge as Louis XIV’s chief opponent. William created the League of Augsburg as a group united against Louis and the French crown. As a consequence, the wealthy and Calvinist Dutch Republic, leading resistance to Louis XIV, became the preferred destination for many Huguenots leaving France after the Edict of Nantes was revoked. In the Dutch Republic, they encountered many Calvinist churches that conducted services in French.\n\n4.  \nStadtholder William III of Orange, who afterwards became King of England, stood out as King Louis XIV’s strongest rival after the French assault on the Dutch Republic in 1672. William responded by bringing together the League of Augsburg against Louis and the French monarchy. For these reasons, numerous Huguenots viewed the prosperous, Calvinist Dutch Republic—at the heart of the anti-Louis movement—as the best option for exile after the Edict of Nantes ended.

      "1.  \nThe graph isomorphism problem asks whether two finite graphs are isomorphic, or essentially the same in structure. In computational complexity theory, a key open question is whether this problem is in P, NP-complete, or somewhere in between (NP-intermediate). While the answer remains unknown, experts generally think it is not NP-complete. This is because if graph isomorphism were NP-complete, it would cause the polynomial time hierarchy to collapse to its second level, something thought to be unlikely. The fastest algorithm currently available, designed by Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks, can solve the problem in 2O(√(n log(n))) time for graphs with n vertices.\n\n2.  \nIn computational complexity, the challenge of determining if two finite graphs are isomorphic is known as the graph isomorphism problem. It is not yet settled whether this problem is solvable in polynomial time (P), is NP-complete, or falls somewhere between (NP-intermediate).

      "1.  \nThroughout most of human history, improvements in material living standards—such as having enough food, access to clean water, and fuel for warmth—have resulted in better health and increased longevity. This connection between higher income and longer life persists in poorer countries today, where rising income leads to substantial gains in life expectancy. However, in recent years, this trend has slowed in middle-income nations and leveled off in the wealthiest thirty or so countries. For example, despite having a higher GDP per capita, Americans, with an average life expectancy of around 77 years in 2004, live no longer than Greeks or New Zealanders, who each average 78 years. In contrast, countries like Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82 years), where wealth is distributed more evenly, have higher life expectancies.\n\n2.  \nHistorically, having better material conditions—fulfilling basic needs like food, clean water, and warmth—meant people lived healthier and longer lives. This link between wealth and longevity remains true in the world's poorer nations, where increases in average income bring rapid rises in life expectancy. But this relationship has weakened for middle-income countries and stalled for the top richest thirty countries. For instance, the average American life expectancy in 2004 was about 77 years, which is not higher than Greece’s or New Zealand’s 78 years, despite Americans having more wealth. Swedes and Japanese, who live in societies with more equal income distribution, enjoy even higher life expectancies of 80 and 82 years, respectively.\n\n3.  \nIn most of human history, greater wealth—meaning adequate food, clean water, and heating—led to people living longer and being healthier. This trend of higher income equating to longer life still applies to low-income countries today. Yet, among countries with middle incomes and the richest thirty nations, this connection has weakened or plateaued. For example, the average life expectancy in the USA in 2004 was 77 years, similar to Greece and New Zealand (both 78 years), though Americans have a higher per capita GDP. People in Sweden and Japan, where income is shared more equally, tend to live longer (80 years and 82 years, respectively).\n\n4.  \nOver much of human existence, higher standards of living—like enough to eat, clean water, and heating—have directly contributed to longer, healthier lives. While this relationship between increased income and lifespan remains strong for poorer nations, it has slowed for those with middle incomes and stopped rising for the world’s thirty wealthiest countries. As an illustration, Americans had an average lifespan of about 77 years in 2004, which is no longer than Greeks or New Zealanders, both at 78 years, even though the US has a higher GDP per person. Meanwhile, Sweden and Japan—with more equal income distribution—show even greater life expectancies at 80 and 82 years.",
      "1. Throughout most of history, people with higher material wealth—those who had enough food, clean water, and fuel to stay warm—generally enjoyed better health and lived longer lives. This link between rising income and greater longevity is still clear in poorer nations, where life expectancy jumps as incomes rise. However, in recent years, this trend has slowed for middle-income countries and stalled among the wealthiest thirty nations. For example, even though Americans have a higher per capita GDP, their average lifespan (77 years in 2004) is no longer than that of Greeks (78) or New Zealanders (78). Meanwhile, countries like Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82) see higher life expectancies, partly due to more equal income distribution.\n\n2. In the past, improved living conditions such as abundant food, access to safe drinking water, and heating fuel translated directly into longer, healthier lives. The correlation between higher earnings and longer life remains strong in lower-income countries. But among middle- and high-income nations, increases in wealth have less impact on longevity; the relationship has flatlined in the richest thirty countries. Take the United States, with a higher GDP per person: its average life expectancy in 2004 was 77 years—no higher than that of Greece or New Zealand (both 78 years). Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82)—where incomes are distributed more evenly—report even longer average lifespans.\n\n3. Historically, greater wealth required for good nutrition, clean water, and warmth was closely tied to improved health and increased lifespan. This is still true in less wealthy countries, where average life expectancy rises quickly with income. Yet, in recent decades, this pattern has weakened in medium-income regions and stopped in the richest group of thirty countries. For instance, despite higher income per person in the United States, Americans did not outlive people in Greece or New Zealand in 2004. By contrast, life expectancy was higher in Sweden and Japan, probably because their income is shared more equally across the population.\n\n4. For much of human existence, better living standards—meaning enough food, clean water, and heat—meant better health and longer lives. This connection is still seen in poorer countries, where people’s lives get longer as their income rises. But for middle income countries, this effect has lessened, and among the world’s richest countries, it has leveled off. In 2004, Americans with higher per capita income had no longer lifespans than Greeks or New Zealanders, both living to about 78 years. In Sweden and Japan, where the wealth gap is smaller, people lived even longer, up to 80 and 82 years respectively.",
      "1.  \nThroughout most of history, improved standards of living—such as having enough food, clean water, and warmth—meant healthier and longer lives. Today, this relationship still holds in poorer nations, where rising incomes lead to large increases in life expectancy. However, in countries with mid-level incomes, the gains have slowed, and in the wealthiest countries, life expectancy has leveled off. For example, despite having a higher per capita GDP, Americans on average do not live longer (77 years in 2004) than people in Greece or New Zealand (both 78 years). Life expectancy is even higher in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82 years), where wealth is distributed more evenly.\n\n2.  \nHistorically, higher material well-being—meaning sufficient food, clean water, and heating—correlated strongly with better health and increased lifespan. This trend persists in less wealthy nations, where as income per person rises, so does life expectancy, often dramatically. Yet, in middle-income countries, this effect has lessened, and in the richest thirty or so nations, it has essentially stopped improving. For instance, Americans (average life expectancy of 77 in 2004) live just as long as Greeks and New Zealanders (78), despite having a higher per capita GDP. In places like Sweden (80) and Japan (82), where income inequality is lower, people live even longer.\n\n3.  \nFor much of human civilization, a higher standard of living—having enough to eat, access to potable water, and fuel for warmth—meant people lived longer, healthier lives. This pattern remains in poorer countries, where life expectancy rises significantly as average income increases. Yet, in recent years, greater income has not translated into longer lives in middle- and high-income nations; in fact, among the thirty wealthiest countries, life expectancy has remained largely the same. For example, Americans (77 years on average in 2004) do not outlive Greeks or New Zealanders (78 years), despite higher incomes. In Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82), where incomes are spread more equally across the population, life expectancy is higher.\n\n4.  \nIn the past, rising material comfort—ensuring adequate food, clean water, and warmth—was directly tied to better health and increased lifespan. This link is still seen in less developed countries, where a rise in per capita income quickly boosts life expectancy. However, in middle-income countries, this benefit has diminished, and in the wealthiest few dozen countries, life span has reached a plateau. For example, although the United States has a higher GDP per person, its average life expectancy (77 years in 2004) is the same or lower than that of Greece and New Zealand (both 78 years). Life expectancy is even greater in countries like Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82 years), where wealth is shared more equally.",
      "1. Throughout much of history, people with better access to basic needs like food, clean water, and fuel enjoyed improved health and longer lifespans. This trend, where rising income boosts life expectancy, continues strongly in the world's poorest countries. However, in the past few decades, this effect has decreased in middle-income countries and has leveled off in the wealthiest nations. For example, Americans in 2004 had a similar average lifespan (77 years) to people in Greece or New Zealand (both 78 years), despite the USA’s higher GDP per person. Meanwhile, countries with more equal income distribution, such as Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82), had even higher life expectancies.\n\n2. Historically, as people's material conditions improved—thanks to better nutrition, clean water, and reliable sources of warmth—their health and longevity also improved. While this direct link between income and lifespan remains evident in poorer nations, it has become less pronounced in middle-income regions and has reached a standstill in the thirty or so richest countries. For instance, in 2004, the average life expectancy in the United States was 77 years, approximately the same as Greece and New Zealand, although America's GDP per person was larger. Sweden and Japan, where wealth is spread more evenly, saw even higher lifespans of 80 and 82 years, respectively.\n\n3. For most of history, increasing access to essentials like food, water, and energy has correlated with better health and longer life. Among the poorest nations, life expectancy rises quickly as income grows. But in recent years, this trend has become less noticeable in middle-income countries and has leveled out in the richest ones. In 2004, Americans lived about as long as Greeks or New Zealanders, despite higher income levels in the USA. Countries like Sweden and Japan, where income is more equally shared, enjoyed even greater longevity.\n\n4. Greater material wealth—having enough food, clean water, and heat—has generally led to longer and healthier lives throughout human history. This connection between income and increased lifespan is especially strong in poorer countries, but in middle-income nations it’s weakened, and in the richest thirty countries, it’s more or less flat. Americans, for example, had an average life expectancy of 77 years in 2004, which is similar to that in Greece and New Zealand, even though the USA is wealthier. In nations like Sweden and Japan, where there’s greater income equality, people live even longer, reaching 80 and 82 years on average.",
      "1. Throughout most of history, improved living conditions—like having enough food, clean water, and heating—meant people enjoyed better health and lived longer lives. This trend still exists in poorer nations, where increasing per capita income is linked to longer life expectancy. However, in recent years, this effect has diminished in middle-income countries and stabilized among the wealthiest thirty or so nations. For instance, despite having a higher GDP per person, Americans in 2004 had a similar average lifespan (77 years) as Greeks and New Zealanders (both 78 years). In comparison, people in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82 years), where wealth is more evenly spread, live even longer.\n\n2. In human history, rising material living standards—access to food, clean water, and fuel—typically brought about better health and greater longevity. Among poorer nations, boosting per capita income still results in significant increases in life expectancy. But this relationship has weakened among middle-income countries and has reached a ceiling in the richest countries. For example, Americans, with a high GDP per capita, had an average life expectancy of 77 years in 2004, which is no higher than that of Greeks or New Zealanders (both 78 years). Swedes (80 years) and Japanese (82 years), who live in societies with more equal income distribution, live longest.\n\n3. Historically, people with higher standards of living—meaning enough food, clean water, and heating—enjoyed better health and longer life spans. This correlation persists in poorer countries, with rising per capita incomes leading to increased life expectancy. However, the connection has weakened in middle-income countries and has leveled off among the thirty richest countries worldwide. For example, Americans' average life span (77 years as of 2004) matches that of Greeks and New Zealanders (78 years), even though the USA's GDP per capita is higher. Meanwhile, life expectancy is even greater in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82), where income is more equally shared.\n\n4. Having more material wealth—such as food, clean water, and heating—was nearly always associated with improved health and longer life for much of humanity’s history. Among poorer nations today, as average incomes rise, so does life expectancy. But in recent decades, this trend has slowed in middle-income countries and stalled in the richest nations. For instance, despite the United States’ higher GDP per capita, Americans in 2004 had the same or even lower life expectancy (77 years) than Greeks and New Zealanders (78 years). People in Sweden and Japan, where incomes are distributed more equally, live longer (80 and 82 years, respectively)."

He was especially shaped by his teachers, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to question even the most renowned thinkers and evaluate ideas through his own experience. Yet, philosophy left him unsatisfied—it could validate reason, but not show how to love God, which was what Luther truly sought. He believed that reason alone couldn't lead people to God, and so he developed mixed feelings about Aristotle because of his focus on reason. Luther came to believe that while reason was valuable for questioning people and institutions, it could not be applied to God. Instead, he thought that true knowledge of God could only come from divine revelation, and as a result, he placed increasing importance on the Bible.\n\n2.  \nLuther, obeying his father's direction, enrolled in law school at the university, but soon abandoned it, thinking the study of law lacked certainty.

His instructors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, influenced him by encouraging skepticism towards even the most established thinkers, urging him to rely on personal experience as a guide. Still, philosophy left Luther unfulfilled—it affirmed the power of reason but didn't help him understand love for God, his deepest concern. He felt that reason couldn't bring someone closer to God and thus formed a conflicted attitude toward Aristotle, critical of his stress on rationality. Luther concluded that reason should challenge human claims, but not divine ones. For him, knowledge of God was only attainable through God’s revelation, making Scripture increasingly central in his life.\n\n3.  \nAt his father's insistence, Luther enrolled in law school that year, at the same university, but quickly dropped out, feeling that law lacked the certainty he desired.

      "Harvard University  \nDuring his presidency from 1933 to 1953, James Bryant Conant revitalized Harvard’s commitment to innovative scholarship, aiming to secure its position as a top research institution. Believing that higher education should benefit those with talent and not just privilege the wealthy, Conant implemented initiatives to discover and support gifted young people. In 1943, he charged the faculty with outlining the essentials of general education for both secondary and collegiate levels. The subsequent report, released in 1945, became a landmark document in American educational history.\n\nUnder James Bryant Conant’s leadership between 1933 and 1953, Harvard University prioritized creative academic work to maintain its superiority among research universities. Conant viewed higher learning as an opportunity for gifted individuals instead of a guarantee for the affluent, leading him to launch efforts to find and nurture talented students. In 1943, he encouraged the faculty to clearly define what general education should consist of, both in high school and college.

The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The new approach, labeled \"LOVE Radio\", featured a small set of music genres and was rolled out across ABC's seven FM stations in November 1968, replacing nearly all previous station content except at some affiliates like KXYZ. In August 1970, Shaw declared that ABC should reassess its FM music offerings to include a broader spectrum of genres."

Because OPEC didn't have efficient methods for updating prices with shifting markets, their real earnings suffered.

Historically, from 1947 to 1967, oil prices saw annual increases of less than two percent and were stable relative to other currencies and commodities. OPEC lacked effective processes to frequently revise oil prices alongside market fluctuations, causing their real incomes to fall behind.

A major factor behind the \"Oil Shock\" of 1973 was OPEC’s delay in adjusting oil prices after 1971 to account for the weakening dollar. From 1947 to 1967, the price of oil in dollars increased at a rate of less than two percent per year, remaining steady against other world currencies and key commodities. With no structured way to keep prices current with the market, OPEC members saw their real earnings decline. When prices spiked dramatically in 1973–1974, OPEC’s revenue and oil prices were effectively restored to the levels seen during the Bretton Woods era if measured by commodities like gold.\n\n3. The \"Oil Shock\" was partly the result of OPEC not raising prices fast enough after 1971 to match the dollar’s depreciation. For two decades prior, the price of oil in dollars grew minimally and was stable compared to other currencies and goods. OPEC didn’t have good processes to adjust prices as markets shifted, which meant their real incomes slipped behind.

      "1.  \nThe 1973 oil crisis played a role in the \"Oil Shock.\" Following 1971, OPEC did not quickly adjust oil prices to account for the dollar’s depreciation. Between 1947 and 1967, oil prices in dollars increased at a rate of less than two percent annually and stayed relatively stable compared to other currencies and commodities. Without proper mechanisms to regularly update prices according to market conditions, OPEC members’ real incomes fell behind. The sharp price hikes in 1973–1974 primarily brought prices and incomes back up to what they had been during the Bretton Woods era, especially when measured against other commodities like gold.\n\n2.  \nAfter 1971, the failure of OPEC to promptly revise oil prices to match the weakening value of the dollar contributed to what became known as the \"Oil Shock.\" From 1947 to 1967, the price of oil in US dollars had gone up very slowly, by less than two percent yearly. Prior to the crisis, oil prices had also been quite steady in relation to other currencies and goods. As OPEC had yet to create systems for regularly updating prices in response to market shifts, their actual earnings fell behind. The major price increases during 1973 and 1974 restored both the price of oil and OPEC’s revenues to levels seen during the Bretton Woods period, particularly in terms of their value relative to commodities like gold.\n\n3.  \nThe \"Oil Shock\" of the early 1970s was partly caused by OPEC’s slow response to dollar devaluation after 1971. Between 1947 and 1967, oil prices in dollars rose by less than 2% each year, remaining quite stable compared with other commodities and currencies. Because OPEC lacked the infrastructure to adjust prices in line with changing market conditions, their real income fell behind. The steep oil price increases of 1973–1974 effectively restored prices and revenues to what they had been during the Bretton Woods system when measured against standards like gold.\n\n4.  \nOne source of the 1973 \"Oil Shock\" was OPEC’s delay in updating oil prices after the US dollar lost value in 1971. For two decades, oil prices in dollars had barely increased and had been steady relative to other goods and currencies. The absence of robust mechanisms for price adjustment meant that OPEC countries’ real earnings did not keep pace with inflation. The big oil price rises in 1973 and 1974 brought prices and incomes back to levels that matched their historical values in the Bretton Woods era as measured by other key commodities, especially gold.",

      "**Rewritten passages:**\n\n1.  \nAccording to Article 294 of the TFEU, most EU laws are made through an \"ordinary legislative procedure\" involving up to three readings. It starts with a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament can block or amend this proposal if a majority of all MEPs agree, rather than just those present. The Council can approve changes by a qualified majority, but it must be unanimous to block Commission amendments. If the institutions disagree, a Conciliation Committee made up of MEPs, ministers, and Commission members attempts to reach a compromise text, which is then sent for approval to Parliament and Council. This structure makes it easier to maintain existing EU law than to change it, as legislation can be stopped by different majorities or minorities in various institutions. Budgetary matters use a different process. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among some member states, Council approval is needed. The Commission is supposed to inform national governments before starting new proposals. The EU can only legislate within the powers given in the Treaties. As per TEU articles 4 and 5, member states retain powers unless specifically transferred, though it’s debated who gets to decide what the EU’s powers are—many national courts or parliaments claim this right, but within the EU, the Court of Justice asserts final authority.\n\n2.  \nThe process for passing most EU laws is set by Article 294 of the TFEU and is called the \"ordinary legislative procedure.\" It involves up to three rounds of review and begins with a proposal from the European Commission. The Parliament must muster a majority of all its members to reject or amend the proposal, not just a majority of those present. On the Council side, a qualified majority can approve changes, but a unanimous vote is needed to block a Commission proposal. If disagreements persist, a Conciliation Committee is formed with members from the Parliament, Council, and Commission to find common ground. Any compromise is sent back for final approval by an absolute majority in Parliament and a qualified majority in Council. This system allows laws to be blocked by different combinations within the institutions, making change more difficult than maintaining the status quo. Budget rules follow another procedure. For a group of member states to proceed with \"enhanced cooperation,\" the Council’s permission is required. The Commission has to notify national governments before starting new legislation. The EU is only allowed to act within powers granted by the Treaties—under TEU articles 4 and 5, leftover powers stay with the member states, though debate continues over which authority has the right to define EU powers. National courts or parliaments often claim this role, while the EU Court of Justice insists it decides in the end.\n\n3.  \nEU lawmaking mainly follows the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" outlined in TFEU Article 294. This process starts with a Commission proposal and can take up to three readings. The European Parliament may block or amend measures with a majority of the entire membership, not just those attending. The Council must muster a qualified majority to accept changes, but full unanimity is necessary to block Commission amendments. Stalemates between the institutions are tackled by a Conciliation Committee comprising representatives from the Parliament, Council, and Commission, who try to produce a joint proposal. If an agreement emerges, both Parliament and Council must give their approval with specific majorities. This setup means legislation can be halted by a variety of actors, so it’s easier to uphold existing laws than to introduce new ones. Budgetary rules use their own process. When a group of member states wants \"enhanced cooperation,\" the Council must approve it. The Commission must inform national governments before starting legislative proposals. Under TEU articles 4 and 5, the EU only has the powers assigned to it by the Treaties, and any remaining powers stay with the member states, though there’s ongoing dispute over who determines the limits of EU powers—national courts and parliaments often think it’s them, while the EU Court of Justice claims it should decide.",
      "**Rewritten passages:**\n\nThe ordinary legislative process for most EU laws is outlined in TFEU article 294. It starts with a proposal from the Commission, followed by up to three readings. Parliament can block or suggest changes by a majority of all its members, while the Council can approve changes with a qualified majority or block changes with unanimity. If the institutions cannot agree, a Conciliation Committee tries to create a joint text, which requires approval from both Parliament and Council. This system makes it easier to block new laws than to pass them. Budget procedures differ, and special rules apply for enhanced cooperation among a subset of member states, needing Council approval. The EU can only make laws where the Treaties grant it powers. TEU articles 4 and 5 clarify that member states hold all powers not given to the EU, but there is debate over who decides the extent of the EU’s powers: member state courts, parliaments, or the EU’s Court of Justice.\n\nUnder EU law, the standard way to pass new laws involves several steps starting with a Commission proposal. The Parliament must have an absolute majority to block or amend, and the Council needs a qualified majority to approve changes or unanimity to block amendments. If there’s disagreement, a Conciliation Committee aims to resolve differences. If successful, both Parliament and Council must approve the final text. This system means changing EU law is intentionally challenging. Budget laws have a different procedure, as does the \"enhanced cooperation\" process, which allows a group of member states to move ahead with approval from the Council. The EU acts only within limited powers assigned by treaties, and there is ongoing debate about who gets to define these powers: national courts, parliaments, or the EU Court of Justice.\n\nThe making of most EU legislation follows the ordinary legislative procedure as spelled out in Article 294 TFEU. The process starts with the Commission's draft, goes through up to three readings by Parliament and the Council, and includes a negotiation phase if agreement is not found. Parliament needs a majority of all members to block or amend proposals, while the Council requires a qualified majority to pass amendments or unanimity to block them. If consensus isn't reached, a Conciliation Committee attempts to find a compromise, which must be ratified by both Parliament and Council. These hurdles make new laws hard to pass. Special procedures are in place for budget issues and for groups of countries wanting closer cooperation, subject to Council permission. The EU’s legal powers are limited by the Treaties; under TEU articles 4 and 5, any powers not handed over stay with member states, but it's contested who decides where these lines are drawn: national bodies or the EU Court.\n\nMost EU laws are created using the ordinary legislative procedure, described in Article 294 of the TFEU. The process starts with a Commission proposal and involves several rounds of deliberation by the European Parliament and the Council. Parliament must have a majority of all its members to change or block a proposal, while the Council can approve with a qualified majority but must be unanimous to block. If there is a deadlock, a Conciliation Committee works to produce a compromise. Both institutions must then approve the final text. Given these checks, it is easier to keep existing laws than to make changes. Separate procedures exist for budgets and enhanced cooperation, which allows some member states to work more closely if the Council agrees. The scope of EU action is limited to powers given by the Treaties, with TEU articles 4 and 5 confirming that other powers stay with member states—though there is disagreement over who decides which powers belong where: member states or the EU Court of Justice.",

If the institutions can't agree, a Conciliation Committee made up of representatives from Parliament, the Council, and the Commission tries to reach a compromise. If successful, the joint proposal must then go back for approval to Parliament and Council, each needing an absolute or qualified majority. This structure means EU laws are more difficult to change than to leave unchanged, since multiple groups must agree to any amendments. Budget rules use a different system. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among some states, Council approval is necessary, and all governments are informed at the outset. The EU can only legislate within the powers given by its Treaties, and there's ongoing debate about who decides the limits of those powers: EU courts, national courts, or national parliaments.\n\n2.\nArticle 294 of the TFEU outlines the main procedure the EU uses to make laws, called the \"ordinary legislative procedure.\" The process begins with the Commission's proposal. The European Parliament can block or make changes if a majority of all its members vote in favor; meanwhile, the Council needs a qualified majority to accept changes or a unanimous vote to block them. If there’s a deadlock, a Conciliation Committee (with representatives from all three institutions) is formed to negotiate a compromise text, which then needs approval from both Parliament and Council. This setup makes changing EU laws deliberately difficult. For EU budgets, another procedure is in place. When a smaller group of countries wants to cooperate more closely, Council approval is required. Moreover, the Commission must inform governments before starting a proposal. The EU’s authority comes from the Treaties, and the question of who gets to determine the EU’s limits—the EU or its member states—is still unsettled, with different bodies claiming final authority.\n\n3.\nThe \"ordinary legislative procedure\" in the EU, defined by TFEU article 294, governs how most new laws are made. It requires up to three rounds of review, starting with a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament can block or amend legislation only if a majority of all its members agree, while the Council must have a qualified majority to support changes and needs to be unanimous to stop Commission proposals. If they cannot reach agreement, a Conciliation Committee of members from all institutions negotiates a final version; for laws to pass, both Parliament and Council must give final approval. This rigorous process means it is typically easier to keep laws unchanged than to amend them. Special procedures exist for budgetary issues. \"Enhanced cooperation,\" allowing certain member states to work closer together, needs Council authorization, and the Commission must notify states before starting legislation. Ultimately, the EU's powers are limited to what’s in the Treaties, but there is a continuing debate about which authority—EU institutions or national ones—gets to set the boundaries of EU powers.",
      "Sure! Here are a few different rewrites of the passage, each on a new line:\n\n1.  \nUnder the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), article 294 lays out the main process for most new EU laws, called the \"ordinary legislative procedure.\" This process involves up to three readings, beginning with a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament can block or amend the proposal with a majority of all its members, not just those present, while the Council of the European Union needs a qualified majority to accept changes and unanimity to reject a Commission proposal. If the Parliament and Council can't come to an agreement, a Conciliation Committee is set up with representatives from all institutions to negotiate a common text. This version is then sent back to be approved by both Parliament (absolute majority) and Council (qualified majority). Therefore, legislation can be stopped by a parliamentary majority, a minority in the Council, or a majority in the Commission, making it more difficult to change EU law than to leave it as is. The budgetary process follows other rules. For actions involving only some states (\"enhanced cooperation\"), the Council must approve. The Commission must also tell national governments before any legislative proposal starts. The EU can only act within powers given by the Treaties; according to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) articles 4 and 5, any powers not given to the EU stay with member states. Disputes remain over who ultimately decides the limits of EU power—national courts and parliaments often claim this right, but the EU Court of Justice also asserts its authority.\n\n2.  \nThe \"ordinary legislative procedure\" under TFEU article 294 is the main way the European Union passes new laws. It begins when the Commission proposes legislation. The European Parliament has to approve changes or block proposals with a majority of all its members, while the Council needs a qualified majority to approve changes but must be unanimous to reject a Commission amendment. If the institutions can't find agreement, a Conciliation Committee of MEPs, ministers, and Commission representatives attempts to work out a compromise, sent back to Parliament and Council for approval. Blocking legislation is easier than changing it, since a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, or a majority in the Commission can all prevent new laws. A different process exists for budget matters, and for initiatives involving only some countries (\"enhanced cooperation\"), Council authorization is needed. The EU's powers are confined to those in the Treaties, with member states retaining all others—though there is ongoing debate about who ultimately interprets these boundaries: some national courts and parliaments claim this prerogative, while the EU Court of Justice believes it is the final authority.\n\n3.  \nMost EU laws follow the \"ordinary legislative procedure,\" as defined by TFEU article 294. The process starts with a Commission proposal. The European Parliament can amend or reject it by a majority of all MEPs, and the Council needs a qualified majority to pass changes but unanimous agreement to block Commission amendments. If they can't agree, a Conciliation Committee is tasked with finding a joint compromise, which is then put to another vote in Parliament and Council. As a result, new laws are harder to pass than to block, since various majorities or minorities can stop legislation at different stages. Budgetary legislation uses a separate process, and \"enhanced cooperation\" among select states requires Council consent. The EU only operates within the powers granted in its Treaties; any other powers belong to member states unless specifically transferred. The question of who ultimately determines EU competence remains contested between national institutions and the EU Court of Justice.\n\n4.  \nAccording to TFEU article 294, most EU legislation uses the ordinary legislative procedure. This involves three readings, beginning with a proposal from the Commission. The Parliament may block or revise proposals if a majority of all MEPs agree, and the Council can approve amendments by qualified majority or reject by unanimity. If there is no agreement, a Conciliation Committee aims to find a compromise for both bodies to approve. Because laws can be blocked at several points, changing EU law is deliberately difficult. Budget rules differ, and for joint actions among some countries, Council approval is needed. The EU can only legislate within powers given by the Treaties, and member states keep all other powers—though there's still debate over whether national bodies or the EU Court of Justice has final word on these boundaries.",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each in a slightly different style or with a different focus:\n\n1.  \nArticle 294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) outlines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" for most EU laws. This process involves three readings that start with a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament must achieve a majority of all its members to reject or amend a proposal, while the Council can approve changes by a qualified majority but needs unanimity to reject a Commission amendment. If the bodies can’t agree, a Conciliation Committee including representatives from the Parliament, Council, and Commission tries to negotiate a joint text, which then goes back for approval by Parliament (absolute majority) and Council (qualified majority). This complex process allows legislation to be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, or a majority in the Commission, making changes difficult. There are separate processes for budgetary matters. For \"enhanced cooperation\" between a minimum number of member states, the Council must authorize it. The Commission should inform national governments before starting the legislative process. The EU can only act within powers given in the Treaties, as per TEU articles 4 and 5—powers default to member states unless explicitly transferred. There is debate over who gets to define EU competence (“Kompetenz-Kompetenz”): some national courts and parliaments claim this role, while the EU’s Court of Justice asserts its own authority.\n\n2.  \nMost EU laws are made using the \"ordinary legislative procedure,\" as set out in TFEU article 294. Under this system, there are up to three rounds of review for proposed laws. These start with a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament can block or amend proposals with an absolute majority, and the Council can only stop amendments by unanimous decision but approves changes with a qualified majority. If disagreements remain at any stage, a Conciliation Committee with members from all three institutions seeks a compromise, which must then be approved again by Parliament and Council. As a result, changing EU laws is more difficult than keeping them; a simple majority in Parliament or minority in the Council can halt new laws. Budget decisions have a different process. If a group of member states wants to cooperate more closely, the Council must authorize it. The Commission is required to notify national governments at the outset. EU powers are limited to those described in the Treaties, and there's ongoing debate about who has the authority to define these powers: member states or the EU's Court of Justice.\n\n3.  \nAccording to TFEU article 294, most EU legislation follows the “ordinary legislative procedure,” involving up to three readings starting with a draft from the Commission. During this process, the European Parliament must have a full majority to amend or block legislation, and the Council needs a qualified majority to pass amendments, but unanimity to reject a change by the Commission. Failure to agree triggers a Conciliation Committee comprised of both Parliament and Council members, together with the Commission, to negotiate a single text that must then be approved again by strict majorities in both bodies. This restrictive setup ensures that while laws can be blocked by modest majorities or minorities, making new laws is a complex process. Budget-making follows a different route. To allow for closer cooperation between some member states, Council approval is required. Also, the Commission must keep national governments informed from the beginning of the process. The EU acts only within the competences assigned by the Treaties, as reaffirmed by TEU articles 4 and 5. There is still ongoing debate over who has the final say in defining these powers, with EU institutions and various national courts each asserting their authority.\n\n4.  \nThe process for passing new EU legislation is mainly governed by the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" in article 294 of the TFEU. This involves three readings and starts with a proposal from the Commission. The Parliament can only block or modify the proposal by a majority of all its members, while the Council can agree to changes by qualified majority or block only by unanimous decision. If agreement cannot be reached, a special Conciliation Committee tries to negotiate a compromise, which is returned for approval by both Parliament and Council. Blocking new laws is relatively straightforward, while making changes requires broad consensus, making it easier for the status quo to prevail. Different rules apply to budget matters. For subgroups of member states wanting deeper cooperation, Council approval is needed. The Commission must notify member governments at the start of the process. The EU’s powers are restricted to what is granted in its Treaties, with continuing debate about which institution—national courts, parliaments, or the EU Court of Justice—has the final word on the EU's powers.\n\nIf you would like versions tailored to a specific reading level, for children, or in a more informal or academic style, let me know!"

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a few different ways, each one separated by a newline.\n\nPassage:\nEuropean Union law\nTo make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

      "1. Harvard economist Robert Barro discovered that there is \"little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment.\" His research from 1999 and 2000 suggests that while high inequality tends to decrease growth in poorer nations, it may actually boost growth in wealthier ones. For example, a study of Swedish counties from 1960 to 2000 showed that inequality had a positive effect on growth for up to five years, but this effect disappeared after a decade. Broader data analyses, however, have found no consistent link between inequality and growth over any fixed period, and they noted that inequality can shorten periods of economic expansion.\n\n2. According to research by Harvard's Robert Barro, there is not a strong connection between income inequality and economic growth or investment overall. His studies point out that high inequality slows growth in poor countries but can accelerate it in rich countries. An examination of Swedish counties from 1960-2000 found that inequality could boost growth in the short term (within five years), but this relationship doesn't last over a ten-year span. Other large-scale studies did not find any links between inequality and growth at any specific time point and observed that inequality often reduces the overall length of growth periods.\n\n3. Robert Barro, a Harvard economist, found little evidence that income inequality consistently affects economic growth or investment rates. He reported that while rising inequality tends to hamper growth in less wealthy countries, it seems to support growth in richer areas. A Swedish county-level study covering 1960 to 2000 showed that inequality was linked to higher growth for up to five years but not beyond ten years. Studies using bigger datasets generally found no fixed-time effects and indicated that inequality might shorten how long economic growth lasts.\n\n4. The relationship between income inequality and economic development is complex. Harvard's Robert Barro concluded that there isn't much of a connection between inequality and growth or investment rates overall. His research revealed that, although high inequality harms growth in poor countries, it can support growth in wealthy ones. A study of Swedish counties found that inequality had a positive impact on short-term growth, but this effect vanished after ten years. Larger studies could not establish any clear timing for these effects and did find that higher inequality often led to shorter growth cycles.",
      "1. Harvard economist Robert Barro has found only a weak connection between income inequality and economic growth or investment. In his research from 1999 and 2000, he observed that while high inequality tends to slow growth in poor countries, it can actually boost growth in wealthier nations. Looking at Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000, one study noticed inequality seemed to spur growth within five years, but not after a decade. Broader studies covering more countries show no consistent relationship at any time frame, and sometimes indicate that inequality shortens the length of growth periods.\n\n2. According to Robert Barro from Harvard, there’s little overall link between how unequal incomes are and how fast economies grow or invest. His findings from 1999–2000 suggest that high inequality might hurt growth in poorer nations but could help richer ones grow. Meanwhile, research on Swedish counties found inequality helped growth over short periods (under five years), but not in the longer term. Larger studies haven’t found reliable connections, and have sometimes shown that inequality reduces how long growth lasts.\n\n3. Research led by Harvard’s Robert Barro revealed that income inequality doesn’t have a strong general effect on economic growth or investment rates. Barro’s work from 1999 and 2000 indicates that high inequality hampers growth in developing countries, but fosters it in developed ones. Analyzing data from Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 showed that inequality’s positive impact on growth is only evident over short periods (five years or less), disappearing after ten years. Extensive data sets generally report no steady relationship, with some evidence that greater inequality may even shorten economic growth spells.\n\n4. Economist Robert Barro from Harvard concluded that there is little direct relationship between income inequality and growth or investment. His late-1990s and early-2000s studies suggest inequality can slow down growth in poorer countries but might stimulate it in wealthier ones. In Sweden, inequality was linked with economic growth for up to five years, yet after ten years, the connection faded. Studies covering more countries over time have failed to show clear correlations, instead sometimes revealing that inequality reduces how long economic growth lasts.",

A separate investigation in Swedish counties (1960–2000) observed that inequality promotes economic growth over short time frames (up to five years), though no such correlation exists after a decade. Larger, more comprehensive studies have failed to find any solid connection for fixed periods and even report that higher inequality can shorten growth spells.\n\n3.  \nRobert Barro, a Harvard economist, has found minimal overall association between income inequality and growth or investment rates.

One study, looking at data from Swedish counties from 1960 to 2000, found that inequality could positively impact growth for up to five years, but not over longer periods like ten years.

Research from Sweden looked at counties from 1960 to 2000 and saw that inequality had a positive effect on growth within five years, but no relationship after ten years. Broader studies with larger datasets, however, found no correlation between inequality and growth at any specific lead time, and instead found that inequality might reduce how long periods of growth last.\n\n2. Robert Barro, a Harvard economist, discovered minimal correlation between income inequality and economic growth or investment rates. His research in the late 1990s and early 2000s showed that inequality hurts growth in poorer countries, but benefits richer countries. An analysis of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 indicated a positive short-term effect of inequality on growth, which vanished after a decade. Larger-scale studies report no consistent connection at any interval, and even suggest that inequality tends to shorten growth periods.\n\n3. According to research by Harvard’s Robert Barro, income inequality has little to no relationship with growth or investment rates. In studies conducted in 1999 and 2000, Barro found that higher inequality slows economic growth in poor countries but accelerates it in rich ones. Looking at Swedish counties over forty years, one study found that inequality promoted growth within a five-year window, but this effect disappeared after ten years. Moreover, analyses using larger sets of data failed to establish a link between inequality and growth for any time frame, and actually observed that inequality can negatively impact how long economic growth persists.\n\n4. Research by economist Robert Barro of Harvard suggests there is generally not much connection between income inequality and economic growth or investment. Barro’s work from the late 1990s found that increased inequality hampers growth in less wealthy countries but brings benefits to affluent ones. For Swedish counties from 1960–2000, inequality was found to aid growth over short periods of up to five years, but not over longer terms. When looking at broader and bigger sets of data, studies did not find any fixed relationship, and some even indicated inequality could shorten periods of economic growth."

      "Certainly! Here are several different rewrites of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\nEconomic disparities have been linked to crime rates, particularly homicides, which are measured similarly across the globe. Numerous studies—over fifty—indicate that violence tends to be more frequent in societies with greater income inequality. These findings span both international comparisons and regional analyses within nations. For instance, Daly and colleagues (2001) observed that U.S. states and Canadian provinces with higher inequality experienced homicide rates up to ten times greater than less unequal regions. Their research suggests that up to half of the differences in homicide rates can be explained by income inequality alone. Likewise, Fajnzylber and others (2002) found a comparable link on a global scale. The academic literature frequently discusses this strong connection between homicide rates and economic inequality.\n\nResearch shows a connection between economic inequality and crime, especially homicide rates. Since homicides are consistently defined worldwide, they provide a reliable basis for study. In more than fifty studies, higher rates of violence appear where there is greater income disparity. Analysis has included both international and regional comparisons. Daly et al. (2001) discovered that among US states and Canadian provinces, places with the greatest inequality had homicide rates up to ten times higher than those with less. They estimated that roughly half the variation in homicide rates was due to income inequality. Similar conclusions were drawn worldwide by Fajnzylber et al. (2002). Academic discussions often highlight this relationship between crime and inequality.\n\nEconomic inequality has also been found to correlate with crime, as evidenced by research focusing mainly on homicides, which have similar definitions globally. More than fifty studies have shown that societies with larger income gaps are generally more violent. This relationship has been confirmed by examining both developed and developing countries, as well as different regions within a single country. Daly and colleagues (2001) demonstrated that US states and Canadian provinces with higher inequality saw a tenfold difference in homicide rates compared to their more equal counterparts, attributing about half the variation in murder rates to inequality. Similarly, Fajnzylber and team (2002) reported consistent results worldwide. The connection between homicide and inequality is frequently discussed in scholarly circles.\n\nCrime rates have been consistently associated with societal inequality, especially in regard to homicides, which are uniformly reported across nations. Over 50 studies suggest that societies with greater income disparities are likely to have higher rates of violence. Researchers have compared countries at various stages of development and have also examined regions within the same country. Daly and colleagues (2001) found that homicide rates in US states and Canadian provinces could be ten times higher in areas of greater inequality, attributing about half of the homicide rate differences to income inequality. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) reached a similar conclusion on a global scale.

      "1.  \nEconomic disparity has been linked to crime rates, with numerous studies indicating that societies with greater income inequality tend to experience higher levels of violence, particularly homicides. Because homicide definitions are consistent across regions, research comparing both different countries and regions within the same country often focuses on this type of crime. For example, Daly et al. (2001) discovered that homicide rates vary by a factor of ten among U.S. states and Canadian provinces and that roughly half of this variation can be explained by the degree of income inequality in each area. Similarly, Fajnzylber et al. (2002) documented the same pattern globally. Academic literature frequently notes the strong connection between social inequality and homicide rates.\n\n2.  \nThere is a documented association between economic inequality and higher crime rates, especially in the case of homicides. Since homicides are consistently defined in legal systems worldwide, researchers have frequently used them to measure the impact of inequality on violence. Over fifty studies suggest that homicides occur more often in places where income gaps are wider. Both international comparisons and regional analyses within countries indicate this trend. Research by Daly and others in 2001 showed a tenfold difference in homicide rates linked to levels of inequality among U.S. states and Canadian provinces, with around 50% of the variations attributed to this factor. The results of Fajnzylber et al. (2002) support these findings on a global scale. Many scholarly discussions emphasize the role of inequality in explaining differences in homicide rates.\n\n3.  \nMany studies have revealed a strong relationship between societal income inequality and crime, especially when examining homicide, which is comparably defined across jurisdictions. Evidence shows that violence, particularly murder, is more prevalent in societies with larger income disparities. This has been confirmed by research comparing both disparate countries and different regions within the same nation. For instance, Daly et al. (2001) observed that homicide rates among U.S. states and Canadian provinces could differ by as much as ten times, with about half of this variation attributable to differences in inequality. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) found similar results from an international perspective. These findings are frequently referenced in academic discussions concerning the link between homicide and economic inequality.",
      "1.  \nEconomic inequality has been linked to higher crime rates, particularly when it comes to homicides, which are similarly defined throughout the world. More than fifty studies have indicated that violence is more common in societies with greater income inequality. Researchers have compared data from both developed and developing countries, as well as between regions within the same country. For example, Daly et al. (2001) discovered that homicide rates in US states and Canadian provinces varied by a factor of ten depending on inequality levels, with about half of these differences explained by variations in inequality. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) found similar global patterns, and several academic papers have discussed the link between inequality and homicide rates.\n\n2.  \nThere is a well-established connection between economic inequality and crime levels, particularly homicides. This is supported by more than fifty studies, which frequently focus on homicide because its definition does not vary much internationally. The evidence suggests that societies with more unequal income distribution experience more violence. Researchers have explored this association in both affluent and less-developed nations, as well as within smaller regions. For example, Daly and colleagues in 2001 showed that differences in homicide rates across US states and Canadian provinces are strongly associated with inequality, accounting for about half the variation. Fajnzylber and colleagues (2002) reported similar findings on a global scale. The academic literature continues to discuss these observations.\n\n3.  \nCrime rates, especially homicides, have often been linked to economic inequality. Studies—over fifty in total—have repeatedly found that violence tends to increase where income gaps are wider. This trend holds true across different countries and within regions of the same country. A notable study by Daly et al. in 2001 revealed that homicide rates in US states and Canadian provinces can vary tenfold due to inequality, which accounts for roughly half of the variation in those rates. Similarly, Fajnzylber et al. (2002) identified the same connection worldwide. Scholarly articles frequently comment on how disparities in wealth contribute to higher homicide rates.\n\n4.  \nThe relationship between income inequality and crime, particularly homicide, is well documented. Homicides are often used in research because their definitions are consistent worldwide, allowing for reliable comparisons. Over fifty studies corroborate that violence is generally more prevalent where there are larger income disparities. Both international comparisons and studies within countries support this link. For instance, Daly and others in 2001 found that differences in inequality among US states and Canadian provinces correlated with a tenfold difference in homicide rates, with about 50% of this difference attributable to inequality.

      "**1.**  \nCrime rates have been found to increase in societies with greater economic inequality. Many studies, especially those focusing on homicides (which are consistently defined across regions), show that violence tends to be more prevalent where income gaps are wider.

The link between homicides and income inequality is widely noted in academic literature.\n\n**2.**  \nThere is a clear link between economic inequality and crime rates, particularly homicide. Most research in this area examines homicide rates, as the definition of homicide is nearly universal. Over fifty studies indicate that violence is more frequent in regions where the gap between rich and poor is larger. This relationship has been observed both in comparisons across countries and within different regions of the same country. According to Daly et al. (2001), variations in inequality account for roughly 50% of the differences in homicide rates among U.S. states and Canadian provinces, with a tenfold difference observed. Fajnzylber et al.

Experts often remark on the strong association between inequality and homicide rates.\n\n**3.**  \nEconomic disparity has been linked to higher crime rates, especially homicide.

Over the next three years, the pope sent a succession of theologians and representatives to confront Luther, which only fueled Luther’s criticism of Rome. Sylvester Mazzolini, a Dominican, prepared charges of heresy, leading to a papal summons for Luther to appear in Rome. With the intervention of Elector Frederick, however, Luther’s hearing was relocated to Augsburg during the Imperial Diet. In October 1518, questioned by Cardinal Cajetan, Luther insisted the papacy wasn’t part of the biblical Church, interpreting scripture to suggest the pope was the Antichrist. This claim became a flashpoint for controversy, and the proceedings collapsed into argument. Luther’s dispute with church authorities, even more than his 95 Theses, branded him as an enemy of the pope. Although instructed to detain Luther if he didn’t recant, Cajetan let him go, and Luther escaped Augsburg at night without the cardinal’s knowledge.\n\n3.  \nPope Leo X, no stranger to reformers and heretics, handled Luther’s challenge cautiously. Over the next several years, he dispatched papal officials who only deepened Luther’s opposition to the Catholic hierarchy. The Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini accused Luther of heresy, prompting a papal summons to Rome; but Elector Frederick arranged for Luther’s questioning at Augsburg instead, during the 1518 Imperial Diet. There, facing Cardinal Cajetan, Luther argued the papacy was not a true part of the Church described in scripture, instead believing prophecy pointed to the papacy as the Antichrist. This interpretation caused significant controversy, and the hearing soon devolved into loud arguments. The confrontation, more than the 95 Theses, made Luther notorious as an opponent of the pope. While Cajetan was directed to detain Luther if he refused to withdraw his statements, he chose not to, and Luther slipped away from Augsburg unseen.\n\n4.  \nAfter Martin Luther’s challenge, Pope Leo X, accustomed to dissent, took careful and measured steps. Over three years he commissioned papal theologians and emissaries to address Luther’s criticisms, but their interventions only intensified Luther’s anti-papal beliefs. Dominican scholar Sylvester Mazzolini built a case against him, and Luther was called to Rome. Thanks to Elector Frederick’s persuasion, the hearing was moved to Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet assembled. In October 1518 at Augsburg, as Cardinal Cajetan pressed him, Luther argued that the papacy was not biblically based and, drawing on scriptural prophecy, called the papacy the Antichrist. This claim ignited widespread controversy and led to heated disputes at the hearing. The encounter with the church hierarchy, more than Luther’s publication of the 95 Theses, marked his emergence as a foe of the pope.

Thanks to Frederick the Elector, Luther was instead allowed a hearing at the Diet of Augsburg. There, in the fall of 1518, Luther was questioned by Cardinal Cajetan and made clear he did not consider the papacy biblically legitimate, aligning the papacy with prophecies of the Antichrist.

      "Certainly! Here are a few different rewrites of the passage:\n\n1.  \nPope Leo X, familiar with dissenters and reformers, initially took a cautious approach to Martin Luther, responding slowly and deliberately. For three years, he sent various papal theologians and representatives to confront Luther, though this only strengthened Luther's opposition to papal authority. The Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini first prepared a case against him, prompting Leo to summon Luther to Rome. However, Frederick the Wise convinced the pope to allow Luther to be examined at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg. There, in October 1518, Luther argued before Cardinal Cajetan that the papacy was not a biblical institution, even suggesting that it represented the Antichrist as foretold in prophecy. This incendiary claim sparked intense debate. The hearings themselves quickly became heated and disorderly. More than his initial 95 Theses, Luther’s clash with church authorities solidified his role as the pope’s foe. Though Cajetan had been instructed to arrest Luther if he did not recant, he chose not to, and Luther quietly left Augsburg under cover of darkness, evading capture.\n\n2.  \nWhen Martin Luther began challenging church doctrine, Pope Leo X—accustomed to heretics—handled the threat cautiously and slowly, dispatching theologians to contend with Luther rather than acting hastily. The first to act was Sylvester Mazzolini, a Dominican, who prepared charges of heresy. Instead of going to Rome as summoned, Luther was examined at Augsburg, thanks to the intervention of the Elector Frederick. In October 1518, standing before Cardinal Cajetan, Luther declared that the papacy was not part of the true biblical church and went so far as to argue it matched scriptural predictions of the Antichrist. These controversial claims fueled further dispute, leading to heated, chaotic hearings. Luther’s direct confrontation with the church hierarchy made him a serious adversary to the pope, far more so than posting his 95 Theses had. Even though Cardinal Cajetan had orders to arrest him if he refused to take back his words, Luther managed to elude capture by secretly leaving Augsburg at night.\n\n3.  \nPope Leo X, experienced in dealing with reformers, approached Martin Luther’s challenge deliberately. He spent years answering Luther with papal envoys and scholars, yet this only reinforced Luther’s opposition to papal power. The Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini compiled the initial charges, and Luther was summoned to Rome but, through Frederick the Wise’s advocacy, was instead questioned at the 1518 Imperial Diet in Augsburg. There, Luther refused to acknowledge the papacy as scriptural, even stating that it fit biblical prophecies about the Antichrist. This became the heart of the theological conflict. The proceedings quickly broke down into chaos. Luther’s open conflict with the church, more than his earlier writings, branded him as the pope’s prominent adversary. Cardinal Cajetan had been told to arrest Luther if he resisted, yet he refrained, allowing Luther to escape Augsburg undetected.\n\n4.  \nPope Leo X dealt with Martin Luther in the same way he dealt with other religious dissenters—cautiously and methodically. Over the next three years, he tried to curb Luther’s influence by sending theologians and church representatives to oppose him, but these efforts only made Luther more critical of the papacy. Initially, Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini began the heresy case, and Leo called for Luther to appear in Rome. With Frederick the Wise’s help, Luther was questioned at Augsburg during the Imperial Diet of October 1518, not in Rome. There, facing Cardinal Cajetan, Luther argued that the papacy did not belong to the true church as found in the Bible and, citing prophecy, labeled the papacy the Antichrist. This charge quickly ignited controversy, and the inquiry devolved into a loud argument. This face-off with the church did more to define Luther as the pope’s enemy than the posting of the 95 Theses had. Although Cajetan was instructed to arrest him if he did not recant, he ultimately allowed Luther to sneak away at night.",
      "1. Pope Leo X, accustomed to dealing with reformers and accused heretics, took his time responding to Martin Luther, acting cautiously and deliberately. Over three years, he sent several theologians and papal representatives to confront Luther—actions that only strengthened Luther’s anti-papal stance.

Thanks to the intervention of the Elector Frederick, Luther was instead examined at Augsburg during the Imperial Diet. In October 1518, while facing questions from Cardinal Cajetan, the pope’s envoy, Luther denied that the papacy was part of the biblical Church, arguing that scriptural interpretations identified the papacy as the Antichrist. Debate over these interpretations quickly became highly contentious, leading to much shouting. It was Luther's bold confrontation with the Church, even more than his posting of the 95 Theses, that established him as a major opponent of the papacy. Although Cajetan had been instructed to arrest Luther if he did not retract his statements, he chose not to, and Luther managed to secretly depart from the city.\n\n2. Pope Leo X reacted slowly and carefully to Martin Luther, accustomed as he was to critics and dissenters. For three years, he employed theologians and papal delegates in efforts to counter Luther, which only made Luther more firmly opposed to papal authority. The pope’s first move was having Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini accuse Luther of heresy and call him to Rome. The Elector Frederick intervened, arranging for Luther to be questioned in Augsburg at the time of the Imperial Diet. There, in October 1518, Luther declared to Cardinal Cajetan, the papal representative, that he did not see the papacy as a part of the biblical Church, believing scriptural prophecy identified it as the Antichrist. This idea soon became central to the debate. The hearings devolved into arguments and shouting. Luther’s challenge to the church hierarchy marked him as a true adversary to the pope. Although instructed to arrest Luther if he refused to back down, Cajetan did not do so, and Luther secretly left Augsburg.\n\n3. When faced with Luther’s challenge, Pope Leo X responded cautiously, a habit formed by previous encounters with reformers and alleged heretics. For three years, he used theologians and papal envoys to confront Luther, but these efforts only radicalized Luther’s opposition to the papacy. Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini prepared a heresy charge, and the pope summoned Luther to Rome. However, at the urging of Elector Frederick, Luther was instead examined in Augsburg at the Imperial Diet. There, in October 1518, questioned by Cardinal Cajetan, Luther said he didn’t consider the pope or the papacy as part of the biblical Church, pointing to prophecies identifying the papacy as the Antichrist. The discussion quickly became heated, turning into a loud argument. Luther’s standoff with Church officials, more than his 95 Theses, painted him as a papal enemy. Although Cajetan was supposed to arrest him if he didn’t recant, he refrained, and Luther slipped out of Augsburg at night, unnoticed.\n\n4. Pope Leo X was familiar with the challenges posed by reformers and suspected heretics, so his approach to Martin Luther was patient and cautious. For three years, he tried to subdue Luther through papal scholars and delegates, but these efforts only solidified Luther’s anti-papal beliefs. The Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini first built a heresy case, after which Leo summoned Luther to Rome. Elector Frederick intervened and arranged for Luther’s questioning to take place in Augsburg, during the Imperial Diet. In October 1518, when interrogated by Cardinal Cajetan, Luther pronounced that, based on his interpretation of biblical prophecy, the papacy was the Antichrist and not part of the biblical Church. This inflammatory charge fueled a major controversy, and the hearings soon became unruly. It was this defiance that, more than the 95 Theses, made Luther a prominent adversary of the pope. Though Cajetan had authority to arrest him for failing to recant, he abstained, and Luther fled Augsburg in secret.",
      "1.  \nPope Leo X, familiar with dealing with reformers and heretics, responded cautiously and took his time. Over three years, he sent theologians and envoys to confront Martin Luther, which only strengthened Luther’s opposition to papal authority. The Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini compiled a case accusing Luther of heresy, prompting Leo to call Luther to Rome. Instead, thanks to the Elector Frederick, Luther was examined at Augsburg during the Imperial Diet. In October 1518, Luther told the papal representative, Cardinal Cajetan, that he did not see the papacy as part of the biblical Church, arguing from prophecy that the pope was the Antichrist. This claim sparked further debate, and the hearings soon became heated. It was Luther’s public challenge to papal authority, more than posting his 95 Theses, that made him a declared opponent of the papacy. Although Cajetan was supposed to arrest Luther if he wouldn’t back down, he refrained. Luther escaped Augsburg by night, without Cajetan’s knowledge.\n\n2.  \nAccustomed to dealing with dissenters, Pope Leo X approached Martin Luther with deliberate caution. For three years, he launched a campaign of papal theologians and envoys to counter Luther, but instead of silencing him, these efforts only fueled Luther’s anti-papal stance. The Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini was the first to build a heresy case against Luther, after which the Pope summoned Luther to Rome. Elector Frederick intervened, so Luther was instead interrogated at Augsburg in 1518 during the Imperial Diet. There, answering Cardinal Cajetan, Luther denied the papacy's legitimacy, citing biblical prophecy that labeled the papacy as the Antichrist. This sparked intense controversy, and the hearings descended into a shouting match. Luther’s battle with church authorities did more to brand him as an enemy of the pope than his original 95 Theses. Although Cajetan had orders to arrest Luther if he did not recant, he did not follow through. Luther quietly left Augsburg at night, evading capture.\n\n3.  \nWhen Martin Luther challenged church practices, Pope Leo X handled the matter with caution, as he was accustomed to confronting religious dissenters. Over several years, he sent papal officials to confront Luther, but their opposition only strengthened Luther’s defiant beliefs. The Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini prepared a formal heresy case against Luther, which led to Luther being summoned to Rome—though, thanks to Elector Frederick’s intervention, he was examined instead at the Diet in Augsburg. In October 1518, before Cardinal Cajetan, Luther argued that the papacy was not part of the true Christian church, basing this on the interpretation that the papacy fit the biblical prophecies about the Antichrist. These views became controversial, and debates grew heated and chaotic. Luther’s direct confrontation with the church solidified his reputation as an adversary of the pope. Although Cardinal Cajetan was ordered to arrest Luther if he refused to renounce his views, he did not. Luther escaped from Augsburg under the cover of darkness, unbeknownst to Cajetan.\n\n4.  \nPope Leo X, accustomed to dealing with movements for church reform and heresy, acted warily and slowly in response to Martin Luther. Rather than weakening Luther, three years of papal interventions—led by theologians and emissaries—made Luther even more critical of the pope. Initially, Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini compiled the charges of heresy, and the pope wanted Luther to appear in Rome. Instead, at Elector Frederick’s insistence, Luther went to Augsburg during the Imperial Diet to be questioned by Cardinal Cajetan. There, in October 1518, Luther explained that he did not regard the papacy as belonging to the biblical Church, drawing from biblical prophecy that called the papacy the Antichrist. These remarks ignited controversy and turned the hearings into loud disputes. This faceoff with authorities—not just his 95 Theses—turned Luther into a leading opponent of the papacy. Though Cajetan had instructions to imprison Luther if he failed to recant, he did not act on them. Luther managed to sneak out of Augsburg at night, slipping away from Cajetan’s grasp."

The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held. There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist. The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.

      "Genghis Khan  \nBy 1206, Temüjin had succeeded in uniting or conquering groups such as the Merkits, Naimans, Mongols, Keraites, Tatars, Uyghurs, and numerous smaller tribes, bringing them all under his leadership. This remarkable achievement led to the collective identity of the \"Mongols.\" During a Khuruldai—a gathering of Mongol chiefs—Temüjin was recognized as the \"Khan\" of these united tribes and adopted the title \"Genghis Khan.\" The higher title of Khagan was only granted to Genghis after his death, when his son Ögedei assumed the designation and applied it retroactively to Genghis, who was also honored as the founder of the Yuan dynasty posthumously. Through this consolidation, Genghis Khan ended tribal conflicts and created a single powerful political and military entity.\n\nBy the year 1206, Temüjin had achieved the remarkable task of merging or subjugating a variety of tribes—including the Merkits, Naimans, Mongols, Keraites, Tatars, and Uyghurs—placing them under his command. This unity gave birth to the collective term \"Mongols.\" At a Khuruldai, a council held by Mongol leaders, Temüjin was declared \"Khan\" of the unified tribes and took on the name \"Genghis Khan.\" The supreme rank of Khagan, however, was awarded to him only after his death by his son Ögedei, who applied the title to himself and then posthumously to Genghis, recognizing him as the founder of the Yuan dynasty.

This impressive accomplishment marked the first time these groups were collectively known as the \"Mongols.\" At a Khuruldai, where Mongol chieftains gathered, Temüjin was declared the \"Khan\" of the combined tribes and took the title \"Genghis Khan.\" He would not be recognized as Khagan until after his death, when his son Ögedei assumed the title and retroactively bestowed it upon him, also naming him the posthumous founder of the Yuan dynasty.

During a Khuruldai, a gathering of Mongol leaders, Temüjin was recognized as the ruler, adopting the new title \"Genghis Khan\". He was not granted the imperial title \"Khagan\" until after his death, when his son Ögedei assumed it and gave it to his father posthumously.

By uniting or defeating the Merkits, Naimans, Mongols, Keraites, Tatars, Uyghurs, and other small tribes by 1206, Temüjin accomplished a remarkable consolidation of disparate groups. This was an unprecedented success for the people who would collectively become known as the Mongols. During a Khuruldai, the traditional meeting of tribal chiefs, Temüjin was proclaimed \"Khan\" and took the new name \"Genghis Khan\".

      "A construction project involves a complicated web of contracts and legal commitments, all of which require thorough attention from every party involved.

Clearly defined contracts, laying out expectations and step-by-step paths to meet them, are much more likely to keep the project on track, whereas unclear agreements often result in misunderstandings and project failure.\n\nIn construction, multiple layers of contracts and legal responsibilities connect all parties, requiring careful consideration from each side.

For instance, Rev. Jimmy Creech lost his clergy credentials after a high-profile trial in 1999 for his role in same-sex union ceremonies. According to church policy, United Methodist groups are not allowed to use church funds to support gay organizations or efforts to promote the acceptance of homosexuality. This policy has led to other clergy being defrocked for similar reasons, with more trials forthcoming. Still, some congregations have sought ways to acknowledge same-sex couples; one even celebrated a couple’s engagement. After same-sex marriage became legal across the United States in 2016, some congregations began blessing same-sex unions. Significantly, in April 2016, a United Methodist bishop publicly officiated a same-sex wedding to advocate for change within the denomination.\n\n3.  \nThe United Methodist Church explicitly bans the celebration of same-sex unions and penalizes clergy who participate in such ceremonies. Rev. Jimmy Creech was defrocked in 1999 after a much-publicized church trial due to his involvement with same-sex couples. Church rules also prohibit any official United Methodist group from using funds to support gay rights organizations or activities that promote the acceptance of homosexuality. Similar actions have led to the removal of other ministers, with additional trials pending. Despite these restrictions, some local congregations have creatively upheld same-sex couples, such as by recognizing engagements. Following the national legalization of same-sex marriage in 2016, a number of United Methodist churches began offering blessings for same-sex marriages. In a notable move that April, a United Methodist bishop performed a same-sex marriage in church to signal his support for reforming church policy.\n\n4.  \nThe United Methodist Church does not permit same-sex unions and enforces this policy by defrocking ministers who defy it. For example, Rev. Jimmy Creech was removed from the clergy after a highly public trial in 1999 for performing same-sex union ceremonies. The denomination also prohibits any of its official groups from funding gay organizations or promoting acceptance of homosexuality. More clergy have lost their credentials for officiating at same-sex weddings, and the trials of others are ongoing. Nonetheless, some churches have responded by finding alternative ways to affirm same-sex couples, including hosting engagement announcements. When same-sex marriage became legal nationwide in 2016, some United Methodist congregations began to provide blessings for these marriages, and in April of that year, a bishop made a public demonstration of support by performing such a wedding.",

      "1.  \nFollowing World War II, Jacksonville, Florida experienced rapid urban sprawl similar to other major American cities. The expansion of highways encouraged many residents to relocate to the suburbs. In response to this growth, city officials boosted spending on public infrastructure during the post-war economic boom. Under Mayor W. Haydon Burns' leadership and his initiative known as the Jacksonville Story, new municipal buildings like a city hall, civic auditorium, and public library were constructed, fostering community pride. Nevertheless, the rise of suburban development and middle-class \"white flight\" left Jacksonville with a diminished and poorer urban population. The percentage of non-Hispanic white residents dropped from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.\n\n2.  \nLike many large American cities, Jacksonville, Florida, faced the harmful impacts of urban sprawl after WWII. New highways made it easier for people to leave the city for suburban housing. After the war, Jacksonville’s government increased its budget for public buildings, spurred on by growth and initiatives like Mayor W. Haydon Burns’ Jacksonville Story, which resulted in new city landmarks and a renewed sense of civic pride. Despite these efforts, suburbanization and \"white flight\" led to a poorer and less populous inner city. As a result, the non-Hispanic white group, once the city’s largest, decreased from 75.8% of the population in 1970 to 55.1% in 2010.\n\n3.  \nAfter WWII, Jacksonville, Florida, was affected by urban sprawl when new highways encouraged people to leave the city for the suburbs. The city responded by investing in major public works projects, especially during the surge of growth after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns’ plan, called the Jacksonville Story, brought about the construction of important civic structures like a new city hall and a public library, which boosted local pride. However, as more people moved to the suburbs and \"white flight\" increased, the city was left with a poorer population and saw its non-Hispanic white demographic shrink dramatically—from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% in 2010.\n\n4.  \nUrban sprawl had a significant impact on Jacksonville, Florida, after World War II, as it did in many U.S. cities. New highways contributed to the growth of suburbs and drew residents away from downtown. In reaction, the local government increased spending to build new public facilities in the booming post-war years, a movement led by Mayor W. Haydon Burns through his Jacksonville Story initiative. Projects like a new city hall and civic auditorium aimed to revitalize the city and inspire pride. Despite these improvements, the city’s population grew poorer due to suburban expansion and the exodus of middle-class white residents, with non-Hispanic whites making up just 55.1% of the population by 2010, down from 75.8% in 1970.",
      "Sure! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each in its own paragraph:\n\nAfter World War II, Jacksonville, Florida experienced the same rapid urban expansion seen in many other American cities. The development of highways encouraged people to move out of the downtown area to live in the suburbs. During this postwar boom, Jacksonville’s city government, led by Mayor W. Haydon Burns, ramped up spending on new public buildings, including a city hall, civic auditorium, and public library, which fostered civic pride. Despite these efforts, suburban growth and “white flight” significantly reduced the city's middle-class population, contributing to economic challenges. As a result, the non-Hispanic white population dropped from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.\n\nLike many large U.S. cities, Jacksonville was heavily impacted by the rapid expansion of its urban boundaries following WWII. Highways were constructed, leading many residents to seek newer homes in suburban neighborhoods. Following this trend, the city government increased funding for public infrastructure, resulting in projects such as a new city hall and library, which aimed to generate civic pride under the leadership of Mayor W. Haydon Burns. Nonetheless, the growth of the suburbs and a migration of the middle class, primarily white families, left Jacksonville’s inner city with growing poverty. Between 1970 and 2010, the percentage of non-Hispanic white residents fell markedly from 75.8% to 55.1%.\n\nJacksonville underwent significant changes after World War II, as did most major U.S. cities. The rise of highways prompted a mass movement of residents into suburban neighborhoods. During this era, under Mayor W. Haydon Burns, Jacksonville invested in landmark public construction such as city hall and the central library, boosting local pride. However, the emergence of suburban areas and the resulting \"white flight\" led to a decrease in the city’s economic resources. The proportion of non-Hispanic whites in the city population plummeted from nearly 76% in 1970 to just over 55% by 2010.\n\nAfter World War II, Jacksonville, Florida was transformed by the same trends that affected large American cities: highways enabled suburban growth, drawing many residents away from the urban core. This period saw the city government, led by Mayor W. Haydon Burns, spend heavily on new public buildings, sparking civic pride. Yet, the movement of middle-class, mostly white families to the suburbs left behind a poorer urban population. The non-Hispanic white population in the city dropped from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% in 2010.",

The local government responded to the post-war economic surge by investing more in public infrastructure projects. Mayor W. Haydon Burns’ initiatives, including the building of a new city hall and other civic structures, boosted civic pride. However, suburban growth and the movement of white, middle-class residents away from the city reduced the wealth of the urban core. The proportion of non-Hispanic white residents in Jacksonville decreased notably from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% in 2010.\n\n3.  \nJacksonville, Florida went through a period of urban sprawl after World War II, a trend matched by other large American cities. Development of highways encouraged people to settle in suburban neighborhoods with newer homes. This move to the suburbs prompted the city government to ramp up spending on large public projects during a time of economic expansion. Mayor W. Haydon Burns led efforts that produced new civic buildings, which instilled pride among locals. Still, as suburbs grew and many white, middle-class families moved away, Jacksonville became less wealthy.

For practical reasons, oxygen is usually transported in bulk as a super-cooled liquid using specially designed tankers, since this method greatly compresses the volume—one liter of the liquid is the same as 840 liters of gas at normal conditions. These tankers supply large outside tanks at hospitals or other sites needing a lot of oxygen. The liquid is run through heat exchangers to become a gas prior to entering the facility. Additionally, compressed oxygen gas is available in smaller cylinders, which are particularly useful for portable medical systems and in welding processes.\n\n3.  \nMethods for storing oxygen include compressing it into high-pressure cylinders, cooling it into a liquid, or binding it with chemicals. To save on costs, oxygen is often shipped in large quantities as a cryogenic liquid using insulated tanker trucks. This is efficient because liquid oxygen is 840 times as dense as its gaseous form at 20 °C and atmospheric pressure.

Liquefied oxygen is typically transported in bulk with insulated tankers, due to its efficiency: a single liter of liquid equals 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at 20 °C and normal pressure. Hospitals and similar sites store this liquid in large outdoor tanks, which are then connected to heat exchangers that turn the liquid into gas for building use. Oxygen is also provided in smaller, compressed gas cylinders useful in portable medical devices and in oxy-fuel welding and cutting work.\n\n4.  \nOxygen can be stored in high-pressure tanks, as a cryogenic liquid, or bound to chemicals. For cost efficiency, the gas is usually transported in bulk as a liquid inside specialized insulated tanker trucks, as this form is much denser than gas (one liter of liquid oxygen equals 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at standard temperature and pressure). These tankers fill up large storage tanks located outside facilities like hospitals. Here, the liquid oxygen passes through heat exchangers to become gaseous before entering the building. Smaller cylinders of compressed oxygen gas are also widely used in portable medical settings and for welding and cutting applications.",
      "1.  \nOxygen can be stored using high-pressure tanks, cryogenic systems, or chemical compounds.

Compressed gas cylinders are another, more portable storage method, useful in medical and industrial tools like welding torches.\n\n4.  \nOxygen storage involves high-pressure tanks, cryogenic liquid systems, or certain chemicals. For bulk transport, oxygen is often carried as a liquid in insulated vehicles since it is far more compact in this form—one liter of liquid oxygen provides as much as 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at 20°C. The tankers supply outdoor storage tanks at hospitals and other facilities that require a steady stream of pure oxygen. Heat exchangers are then used to turn the liquid back into a gas as needed. Smaller, compressed gas cylinders are also common and are handy for portable medical uses and metalworking."

    "context": "While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n1.  \nAlthough the European Commission uniquely holds the right to propose new laws, both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union can modify or reject legislation as it moves through the legislative process. The Treaty on European Union, particularly articles 9 and 10, highlights the EU’s commitment to citizen equality and representative democracy. However, in practice, these ideals fall short because Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) cannot introduce legislation if the Commission objects, and citizens in the smallest countries wield disproportionately greater voting power compared to those in larger nations. Additionally, significant majorities or consensus in the Council are required to pass laws. This “democratic deficit” is often explained by the need for technocratic integration of European systems, especially before public understanding and acceptance caught up after World War II. Over time, the Parliament’s authority has grown: transitioning from an unelected body, to hosting direct elections starting in 1979, to having a stronger legislative voice. Even so, EU citizens enjoy fewer rights than they do within their own nations. Under TEU article 11, they can campaign and petition the Commission if supported by at least a million signatures, while TFEU article 227 allows them to petition the Parliament on issues affecting them. Parliament elections happen every five years by proportional representation or the single transferable vote method, allocating 750 MEPs in a way that favors smaller states (\"degressive proportionality\"). This setup means citizens of smaller countries have a bigger say in Parliament than those of larger ones. MEPs typically align with political party groups, with the European People’s Party and the Party of European Socialists leading the major coalitions. Political parties are not funded by the EU, after a court ruling that such financing is a matter for national regulation. Parliament can investigate maladministration, appoint an Ombudsman, demand responses from the Commission, and even force the Commission’s resignation with a two-thirds vote, as happened in 1999. While Parliament holds some consultation rights in legislation, it ultimately relies on the Commission and Council to pass laws, which limits the direct democratic power of EU citizens: real legislative authority does not rest solely with the people’s elected representatives.\n\n2.  \nThe European Commission is alone responsible for starting new laws in the EU, but both the Parliament and the Council have the power to amend or veto proposed legislation. The EU’s founding treaties promise equality and representative democracy, but these principles are compromised. Parliamentarians cannot introduce laws without the Commission’s backing, and people in smaller countries have much more voting influence than those in larger ones. Passing EU laws also requires large majorities or consensus in the Council. This situation, commonly referred to as a “democratic deficit,” was originally rationalized by the need for experts to coordinate European integration after WWII, while public engagement was still low. Since then, the Parliament has gained more influence: first becoming directly elected in 1979 and gradually expanding its legislative rights. Nonetheless, EU citizens have fewer democratic rights than in their national systems. They can submit issues to the Commission with a million signatures, or petition the Parliament directly on matters that impact them. Parliamentary elections happen every five years, with seats distributed disproportionately to benefit smaller countries, giving their citizens louder voices. The Parliament's members are organized primarily along party lines, with the European People’s Party currently in the majority, and the Party of European Socialists in opposition. EU institutions do not fund these parties, following a court ruling that such things are left to the member states. Parliament’s powers include investigating wrongdoing, appointing an Ombudsman, questioning the Commission, and, with a sufficient majority, dismissing the Commission—something which last happened in 1999. Despite all these roles, the Parliament remains dependent on the Commission and Council for legislation, meaning ultimate legislative authority does not rest directly with the people’s elected representatives.\n\n3.  \nIn EU lawmaking, only the European Commission can formally propose legislation, though both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union can make changes or block these proposals. The EU, as laid out in its Treaties, aspires to citizen equality and representative democracy, yet practices often deviate from these ideals. MEPs cannot introduce new legislation without the Commission, and citizens from small member states have far more voting power in Parliament compared to those from large member states. Passage of most legislation requires a qualified majority or consensus in the Council. The historic rationale for this so-called “democratic deficit” has been the technical and economic integration managed by experts, allowing time for greater public understanding post-WWII. Parliament’s influence has increased over time, transitioning from a nominated body, to holding EU-wide elections in 1979, to accruing more legislative sway. Citizens’ rights to participate directly are still limited; under TEU article 11 they can promote their views and initiate proposals if they gather a million signatures, and under TFEU article 227 they can submit petitions relevant to their concerns. Parliamentary elections occur every five years with proportional representation, but seat numbers are adjusted so that smaller member states are overrepresented. Thus, people in less populous states have more say than those in larger ones. Political groups like the European People’s Party and the Party of European Socialists dominate MEP alignments. Funding for these parties does not come from the EU itself, as national regulation determines such matters. Parliament is empowered to probe EU administration, appoint an Ombudsman, question the Commission, and, with a supermajority, dismiss the Commission, as happened in 1999. It has some rights to consultation in legislative drafting, but lacks the final say; real legislative power remains split between the Commission and Council, meaning the EU’s democratic foundations are not as robust as those of its individual members.",
      "Certainly! Here are a few different rewrites of the passage, each with a unique style and phrasing, separated by newlines:\n\n---\n\nAlthough the European Commission alone can propose new laws, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union can suggest changes and block proposals as the laws are passed. Treaty articles 9 and 10 affirm that the EU is built on the values of equality and representative democracy. Yet, in reality, there are significant shortcomings: Parliament cannot put forward legislation without the Commission’s approval, citizens from smaller countries have much more influence per vote than those from larger ones, and important Council votes often need a strong consensus. The rationale for these democratic gaps is that integration required expert management after World War II, with the expectation that public understanding and acceptance would grow over time. In line with this, the Parliament has slowly gained more influence—from an appointed body, to holding direct elections since 1979, and getting a bigger say in lawmaking. Nonetheless, EU citizens have more limited rights than within their national democracies. Citizens do have some direct rights: under TEU article 11, they and their associations can share opinions publicly or force the Commission to consider their proposals if backed by a million signatures. Article 227 TFEU also lets citizens petition Parliament about matters that affect them. Elections to the 750-member Parliament occur every five years and must use proportional or single transferable voting. Seats are distributed so that smaller states get more representation per person than larger ones. Parties in Parliament align along ideological lines, like national legislatures, with the European People’s Party currently leading and the Party of European Socialists forming the main opposition. Importantly, the EU itself does not fund these parties, a rule upheld by the Court of Justice. The Parliament can investigate issues, appoint an Ombudsman, question the Commission, and even dismiss the Commission with a two-thirds vote, as in the Santer Commission case in 1999. Some laws also require Parliament to be consulted. Still, Parliament cannot pass laws without the Council and Commission, so real legislative power is not fully in the hands of elected representatives—in the EU, rule by the people is not yet fully realized.\n\n---\n\nIn the European Union, only the Commission can introduce new laws, while both the European Parliament and the Council have the potential to change or veto them. Although EU treaties say the union is based on equality and representative democracy, in practice there are flaws: Parliamentarians cannot propose laws themselves, people in smaller nations have more parliamentary influence per capita, and significant Council agreement is necessary for anything to pass. This arrangement was historically justified by the need for expert-guided integration of Europe after WWII. Over time, the Parliament has gained more authority—turning from an appointed group to a directly elected and more influential legislative body. However, democratic participation remains weaker compared to individual member states. Citizens can submit proposals for EU consideration with enough support under article 11 TEU, or petition Parliament under article 227 TFEU. MEPs are elected every five years under proportional systems, with seat numbers favoring smaller countries. Political groups reflect EU-wide ideologies, with the largest bloc currently being the European People’s Party. The EU does not publicly fund these parties. The Parliament can oversee, question, and even dismiss the Commission, and must be involved in some legislative consultations—but it cannot legislate independently. True democratic power still doesn’t lie entirely with the elected representatives.\n\n---\n\nThe legislative process in the EU is largely initiated by the European Commission, while the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union may amend or block proposed laws. Though the EU claims to operate on principles of equality and representative government as per its core treaties, the Parliament’s lack of legislative initiative powers, disproportionate representation favoring smaller states, and the Council’s requirement for large voting majorities mean democracy is limited. This has been justified historically by the need for technically managed integration as the European project evolved. Parliament has grown from an advisory body to one with directly elected members and greater rights, though still less than national parliaments. EU citizens are able to voice concerns, petition the Parliament, and organize initiatives if they gather significant support, but these rights are narrower than those at the national level. Parliament elections occur every five years via proportional systems, and MEPs represent states on a degressively proportional basis, so citizens in smaller countries have a louder voice. The Parliament follows party politics much like national bodies, with the main groups being the conservative European People’s Party and the Party of European Socialists. These parties are not funded by the EU itself, as decided by the European Court of Justice. The Parliament may investigate, question, and even dismiss the Commission, and must be heard in certain legislative scenarios, but its legislative power is limited because all laws need both the Commission and Council. Therefore, direct democratic rule is not fully established at the EU level.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like more styles or another approach!",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the provided passage, each separated by a newline:\n\n---\n\nAlthough only the European Commission can propose new legislation within the European Union, both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union play key roles by amending and approving or rejecting proposed laws. The Treaties of the European Union, particularly articles 9 and 10, emphasize equality and representative democracy for EU citizens. However, deficiencies remain: the Parliament cannot introduce legislation independently of the Commission, voting weight is skewed towards smaller countries, and major legislation requires broad consensus in the Council. The rationale for these imbalances, often referred to as the \"democratic deficit,\" is that technical integration was prioritized in the EU's early years, with expert coordination deemed essential while public engagement and understanding developed after WWII. Over the years, the Parliament's influence has grown—from an unelected body, to one directly elected since 1979, and gradually gaining more legislative powers. Yet, rights for citizens are less extensive than in EU member states' democracies: for example, citizens can petition the Commission with a million signatures (TEU article 11) or submit complaints to Parliament (TFEU article 227). European Parliament elections are held every five years using proportional systems, with the number of MEPs (currently 750) allocated so smaller states have relatively more representation. These MEPs organize along political party lines, with parties like the European People’s Party and the Party of European Socialists. Notably, the EU doesn’t fund these parties directly, as confirmed by the European Court of Justice. The Parliament can investigate administration, appoint an Ombudsman, question the Commission, and even remove it by a two-thirds vote, as happened in 1999. While it sometimes has a formal consultative role, the Parliament still cannot legislate independently—the Commission and Council remain indispensable. Therefore, the EU’s legislative power is not fully in the hands of directly elected representatives; it remains a system where administration is not yet “by the many.”\n\n---\n\nIn the European Union, legislative proposals must originate from the Commission, while the Parliament and Council hold powers to amend and veto them as they progress. As stated in the Treaties, especially articles 9 and 10, equality and representative democracy are core EU principles. In practice, however, the process falls short: the Parliament lacks the ability to initiate legislation against the Commission, smaller countries have disproportionately high voting power, and the Council’s consensus is essential for passing laws. This so-called \"democratic deficit\" was partly justified by the need for expert-driven integration that outpaced public engagement immediately after WWII. Over time, the Parliament’s authority has expanded, shifting from an unelected to a directly elected body since 1979, with more legislative input. Nevertheless, EU citizens’ influence is more limited than in their home countries; citizens may submit a popular initiative to the Commission or petition Parliament, but ultimate legislative control remains restricted. European Parliament elections are conducted every five years with proportional representation, and member states have representation that is degressively proportional, favoring smaller nations. Parliamentary divisions mirror those of national assemblies, aligning along party lines, but the EU does not directly finance these parties. The Parliament can investigate the Commission, appoint an Ombudsman, and, with a supermajority, even dismiss the Commission. Still, without the Commission and Council’s approval, no legislation passes, and thus ultimate power remains only partially in the hands of elected officials.\n\n---\n\nWithin the structure of the European Union, legislative authority begins with the Commission, which alone can formally propose laws. The European Parliament and Council, however, play crucial roles in shaping and accepting or rejecting these laws. According to the major Treaties, the EU is supposed to guarantee equality and representative democracy for its citizens, but significant gaps still exist. The Parliament cannot initiate legislation independently, smaller states enjoy disproportionately greater voter influence, and consensus in the Council is often needed. These democratic shortcomings are typically defended on the basis that intense technical integration after WWII needed expert input, given limited public understanding and strong nationalist attitudes at the time. The Parliament has gained greater responsibilities, evolving from an unelected assembly to a directly elected chamber with some increased rights. Still, compared to national democracies, citizens’ rights within the EU are restricted: they may campaign and submit initiatives, and they can petition Parliament, but lawmaking remains predominantly in others’ hands. Parliamentary elections use proportional representation and “degressive proportionality” to determine MEP numbers, giving smaller states an outsized voice. Political groups function as they do in national parliaments, though EU party funding is left to national governments. Parliament can supervise the Commission, demand answers, and censure the body, but cannot make laws on its own—real authority remains divided among the central institutions.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further rewrites, a shorter summary, or a version tailored for a specific audience or reading level!",
      "**Rewritten passages:**\n\nThe European Commission is solely responsible for proposing new laws in the EU, but both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union can amend or reject these proposals. Though the EU treaties state that the Union should be based on equality and representative democracy, in reality, the democratic process is limited: Parliament cannot propose its own legislation against the Commission’s wishes, smaller countries’ citizens have votes that count much more than those from bigger countries, and most laws require broad agreement among member states. This so-called “democratic deficit” has been justified on the grounds that economic and political integration called for expert-driven coordination, especially as public allegiance to the EU was still developing after World War II. Over time, Parliament’s influence has grown—it went from being an unelected body to directly elected in 1979, with greater involvement in lawmaking. Nevertheless, citizens still have fewer democratic rights than in their individual countries; they can campaign and submit initiatives to the Commission if they gather at least one million signatures (TEU article 11), and can petition Parliament directly (TFEU article 227). Parliamentary elections are held every five years using proportional representation, and the 750 MEPs are distributed in a way that gives smaller countries more MEPs per person than larger ones. Political groupings in the Parliament reflect the spectrum found in national assemblies, with the European People’s Party currently the largest. The parties don’t get EU funds, based on a ruling from the Court of Justice. Parliament can investigate maladministration, appoint an Ombudsman, question the Commission, and even remove it with a two-thirds vote—but it still lacks the power to pass laws independently. As a result, real legislative power isn’t fully in the hands of directly elected representatives: democracy in the EU remains incomplete.\n\n---\n\nThe lawmaking system of the European Union gives the Commission exclusive authority to propose legislation, while the Parliament and Council have the power to amend or veto but not initiate laws independently. Although EU treaties call for citizen equality and representative democracy, in practice there are shortcomings. The Parliament cannot introduce laws against the Commission, citizens from smaller countries have much more influence per person than those from large countries, and passing laws often requires wide agreement among states. Historically, this “democratic deficit” was defended as necessary to manage complex integration by experts as the union and its citizens found their footing after the war. Parliament’s role has increased gradually—from being unelected to holding direct elections since 1979 and gaining additional powers, but EU citizens have fewer democratic rights than in their own nations. While they can submit an agenda initiative with enough signatures or petition Parliament, and while MEPs are broadly chosen by proportional representation for five-year terms, smaller countries still enjoy disproportionately higher representation. Political power in Parliament is currently dominated by the European People’s Party, and parties are funded by their national governments, not the EU itself. Parliament can conduct investigations, request answers from the Commission, and, with a supermajority, dismiss the Commission, but it lacks final legislative authority. In essence, the EU legislature remains only partly democratic, as the people’s directly elected representatives do not have full control over lawmaking.\n\n---\n\nWithin the European Union, the Commission starts all new legislation, controlling the legislative agenda, while the Parliament and the Council can only amend or block proposals. The EU claims to be founded on principles of equality and representative democracy, but in reality, the system falls short: Parliament members cannot propose laws on their own, citizens’ voting power varies dramatically between member states, and most legislation requires approval by qualified majorities or consensus. This “democratic deficit” is often explained by the need for technical leadership during early EU integration. While the Parliament’s role has expanded—from an advisory group to an elected body with more influence—it still does not have the same democratic legitimacy or power seen within individual member states. Citizens can influence policy through petitions or initiatives, but all legislative change ultimately depends on the Commission’s consent. Elections to the Parliament occur every five years with seats distributed so smaller countries get more representation per citizen. MEPs form political groups, with the European People’s Party currently the largest. The Parliament has oversight powers, such as inquiries and the ability to dismiss the Commission, but still lacks the authority to independently pass laws. Thus, despite incremental changes, ultimate legislative power in the EU does not rest with the directly elected representatives, leaving the democratic ideal only partially fulfilled.",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions, each in a unique style or structure, separated by newlines:\n\n**1. Summarized Academic Tone:**  \nIn the EU lawmaking process, the European Commission exclusively initiates legislation, but the Parliament and Council possess amendment and veto powers. The EU is intended to uphold equality and representative democracy, per Treaty articles 9 and 10; however, real practice falls short, as Parliament can’t propose laws independently, and smaller states’ citizens have disproportionate influence. Historically, this imbalance—often called the \"democratic deficit\"—was seen as necessary for technical integration while public understanding evolved. Incrementally, Parliament has gained more power, moving from an unelected body to direct elections and greater legislative rights. Nevertheless, EU citizens enjoy fewer democratic rights than within their own states: they can petition and launch initiatives, but actual legislative power stays with the Commission and Council. Parliament elections occur every five years under proportional systems, and smaller countries gain more representation per capita. Party politics in Parliament mirror national patterns, but without EU funding for parties. Parliament can conduct inquiries, appoint an Ombudsman, and censure the Commission, but no legislation can pass without approval from all institutions, signifying limited popular power.\n\n**2. Informal Explanatory Version:**  \nIn the EU, the Commission is the only body allowed to start new laws, while the European Parliament and the Council can suggest changes or block them. Although the EU claims to be democratic and treats all citizens equally, things aren’t that simple. The Parliament can’t push its own laws if the Commission disagrees, and people in small countries get more voting power than those in big countries. This setup was meant to help experts build the EU before regular citizens really got involved, but it means democracy is a bit lacking. Over time, Parliament has gained more rights and is now elected directly, but compared to national governments, EU citizens don’t have much of a say. They can still collect signatures to propose ideas or petition Parliament, but real lawmaking needs agreement from both the Commission and Council. Elections are held every five years and use proportional voting, but smaller countries get more representation per person. Political parties in Parliament don’t get funding from the EU, and Parliament can investigate problems or even fire the Commission, but it still can’t pass laws without the other bodies.\n\n**3. Legalistic Paraphrase:**  \nEU legislative authority resides primarily with the Commission, which exercises exclusive rights to propose legal measures, while Parliament and the Council have authority to amend or veto. Articles 9 and 10 of the Treaty on European Union establish foundational commitments to citizen equality and representative democracy, yet substantive deficits persist. The European Parliament lacks autonomous legislative initiative, representation is skewed in favor of smaller states, and complex voting requirements hamper legislative progress. These deficiencies, deemed necessary for the technical evolution of EU institutions, have been gradually offset by increased Parliamentary powers, such as inquiries, petitions, and limited legislative participation. Despite these advancements, ultimate legislative initiation remains outside Parliament’s remit, constraining direct democratic accountability at the Union level.\n\n**4. Bullet Point Version:**  \n- The European Commission has the sole right to propose new laws.  \n- European Parliament and Council can amend or reject proposed laws, but not initiate them.  \n- Treaty provisions aim for equality and representative democracy, but in reality these are incomplete.  \n- Parliament cannot introduce legislation against the Commission’s wishes.  \n- Citizens of smaller EU countries have more voting power in Parliament than those in larger countries.  \n- The \"democratic deficit\" is justified by the technical needs of unifying Europe.  \n- Parliament’s power is increasing, but still limited compared to member states’ systems.  \n- Citizens can propose initiatives with enough signatures and petition Parliament.  \n- Parliament elections happen every five years, using proportional representation.  \n- MEP numbers are “degressively proportional,” so smaller countries are overrepresented.  \n- Political parties in Parliament follow similar lines as in national politics, but are not EU-funded.  \n- Parliament can investigate issues, appoint an Ombudsman, and censure the Commission, but cannot pass laws independently.\n\n**5. Simple Summary:**  \nIn EU law, only the Commission can formally propose new laws, while Parliament and the Council can change or reject them. Despite claims of equality and democracy, real power is imbalanced: smaller countries have more influence and Parliament can’t propose laws alone. EU citizens can petition and suggest initiatives, but actual lawmaking power is still mainly with the Commission and Council, not directly-elected representatives. Over time, Parliament’s authority has grown, but it remains limited compared to national governments."

In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

A less ambitious version was adopted as the Social Charter during the 1989 Strasbourg European Council. The Charter outlines 30 general principles, covering areas such as fair pay, workplace health and safety, the rights of disabled and elderly persons, workers' rights, vocational training, and improved living standards. These principles inspired around 40 legislative acts within the European Community.\n\n2.  \nWithin the scope of European Union law, the Social Chapter—added to the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam—deals with matters of social policy.

The Social Charter provided the foundation for 40 pieces of European Community legislation in these areas.\n\n3.  \nThe Social Chapter, which forms part of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, focuses on social policy in the context of European Union law. It originated in 1989 when representatives of employers, trade unions (ETUC), and public enterprises (CEEP) known as the \"social partners,\" established its groundwork. A milder form, known as the Social Charter, was officially adopted at the Strasbourg European Council of 1989. The Charter articulates 30 overarching principles, including the right to fair wages, safe workplace conditions, the protection of the disabled and elderly, workers' rights, access to vocational training, and the promotion of better living standards.

      "1.  \nChloroplasts in plant and algal cells adjust their positions based on light levels. When light is scarce, they spread out to capture as much as possible. In bright light, chloroplasts line up vertically along the cell wall or turn to minimize the amount of light hitting them, protecting themselves from damage caused by too much light. This capacity to either cluster together or spread out may explain why terrestrial plants have lots of small chloroplasts, rather than just a few large ones. The movement of chloroplasts is one of the most precisely managed responses in plants. Interestingly, mitochondria have been seen following the motions of chloroplasts.\n\n2.  \nIn response to changing light conditions, chloroplasts within plant and algal cells move to optimize light absorption. During dim light, they expand into a sheet-like arrangement to maximize exposure. Conversely, in strong light, they shield themselves by forming vertical lines or orienting sideways, thus reducing their exposure and protecting against light-induced damage. This ability to reposition may be why land plants typically have many small chloroplasts rather than just a handful of large ones. The system controlling chloroplast movement is among the most tightly regulated in plants, and mitochondria are known to trail their movements.\n\n3.  \nPlant and algal cell chloroplasts can reorient themselves depending on how much light is present. Under low-light conditions, they fan out to absorb as much light as possible, but in very bright light, they align vertically or turn so only their sides face the incoming light, thus reducing the amount they absorb and preventing photooxidative damage. This self-protective movement, allowing them to either cluster together or spread out, may be why land plants have evolved numerous small chloroplasts instead of a few large ones. The way chloroplasts adjust their position is one of the most carefully controlled actions in plants. Mitochondria have also been seen to follow the paths of moving chloroplasts.\n\n4.  \nChloroplasts in the cells of plants and algae can rearrange themselves according to light conditions—spreading out thinly under low light to maximize light capture, or stacking up vertically or turning edgewise when light is too intense, which helps limit their exposure and protect them from damage. This flexible organization, allowing chloroplasts to either shelter or distribute themselves as needed, might be why land plants have many smaller chloroplasts rather than just a few bigger ones. Chloroplast movement stands out as one of the most finely tuned responses in plants, with mitochondria occasionally following their lead.",
      "1.  \nChloroplasts in plant and algal cells have the ability to move and position themselves according to the light levels they encounter. When light is scarce, they spread out flat to catch as much light as possible. In contrast, when exposed to strong light, they arrange themselves in vertical stacks against the cell wall or rotate, making themselves less exposed to direct light. This movement both maximizes photosynthesis and protects the chloroplasts from light-related damage. Having many small chloroplasts, rather than a few large ones, likely evolved to take advantage of this adaptable movement. This process is considered one of the plant's most precisely regulated ways of responding to environmental signals. Additionally, mitochondria in these cells have been seen moving in coordination with the chloroplasts.\n\n2.  \nPlant and algae cells contain chloroplasts that can reposition themselves in response to different lighting conditions. In dim light, chloroplasts expand across the cell to increase light capture. Under very bright light, they move so they are aligned vertically along the cell wall, or turn so only their edges are exposed, reducing the surface area exposed to light. This helps prevent damage from excessive light. The ability to both hide and spread out might explain why plants evolved numerous small chloroplasts instead of larger ones. Chloroplast movement is among the best controlled stimulus-response mechanisms in plants, and mitochondria are often observed to move in step with chloroplasts.\n\n3.  \nChloroplasts in plant and algal cells actively rearrange themselves to optimize their exposure to light. When light levels are low, they fan out to maximize light absorption. In contrast, in strong light, they reposition to minimize exposure, either stacking along the cell wall or rotating so that less surface area faces the light source. This self-regulation helps guard against the harmful effects of excess light. The evolution of many small chloroplasts in land plants, as opposed to a few larger ones, may be tied to this protective distribution. This dynamic movement of chloroplasts is recognized as one of the most finely tuned response systems in plants, and interestingly, mitochondria frequently move alongside chloroplasts during these changes.",
      "1.  \nChloroplasts in plant and algal cells are able to adjust their position depending on how much light is present.

If the light is very strong, the chloroplasts line up along the cell wall or turn sideways, reducing their exposure and protecting themselves from light-induced damage. This ability to rearrange themselves—either by spreading out or stacking up—may explain why land plants typically contain many small chloroplasts instead of just a few large ones. Such movement is among the most tightly regulated responses in plants. Interestingly, mitochondria often follow these movements as well.\n\n2.  \nIn plant and algal cells, chloroplasts can shift their positions to make the most of the surrounding light. During dim lighting, they spread flat to maximize light absorption. Conversely, if the light is too bright, they group up vertically or turn so that only their edges face the light, thereby limiting exposure and protecting themselves from potential damage.

If the light is very strong, they protect themselves by lining up vertically along the cell wall or turning so only their edges face the light, minimizing exposure and preventing damage from too much light. This smart positioning—either hiding behind each other or spreading out—may explain why land plants have developed many small chloroplasts instead of a few large ones. This movement in response to light is one of the most tightly controlled behaviors in plant cells. Interestingly, mitochondria often move along with the chloroplasts as they shift around.\n\n2.  \nChloroplasts in the cells of plants and algae are able to change their arrangement based on lighting conditions. In dim light, they fan out to maximize their exposure and better absorb available light. But in bright or intense light, they realign—either aligning themselves in columns along the cell wall or rotating so their thinnest side faces the light—reducing how much light hits them and preventing harmful photooxidative effects. The need for this flexibility could be why land plants tend to have many small chloroplasts rather than only a few large ones. The way chloroplasts move in response to light is among the most carefully regulated responses in plants. Additionally, mitochondria are sometimes seen tracking the movement of chloroplasts.\n\n3.  \nWithin plant and algal cells, chloroplasts are able to reposition themselves according to the amount of available light. When light is low, they disperse to increase the surface over which they can absorb sunlight. In situations of intense lighting, they line up vertically or orient themselves so that less light hits them, preventing potential light-induced damage. This movement strategy—alternately taking cover or spreading out—may have driven the evolution of numerous small chloroplasts in land plants. The ability of chloroplasts to move in response to light is one of the most controlled stimulus-response mechanisms in plants. Mitochondria have also been noticed to move with the chloroplasts.\n\n4.  \nChloroplasts in plant and algal cells adjust their position to get the most out of the light they receive. When it's dim, they move apart, forming a wide layer to catch as much light as possible.

This adaptive movement—spreading out or seeking cover—is likely a key reason land plants have many small chloroplasts rather than just a few large ones.

Every actor introduces unique traits to the role, yet they all represent the same character along one continuous storyline. Thanks to the series’ time-travel aspect, various Doctors sometimes meet on screen. After Matt Smith left in the 2013 Christmas special called \"The Time of the Doctor,\" Peter Capaldi assumed the role.\n\n3. In the history of \"Doctor Who,\" twelve actors have played the title character, the Doctor. The series has a built-in explanation for these changes: regeneration, a process Time Lords undergo when seriously injured, allowing the Doctor to gain a new appearance and personality. All portrayals by different actors are intended as facets of the same character, keeping the story’s continuity intact. Occasionally, due to the time-travel theme, different iterations of the Doctor encounter each other. Peter Capaldi succeeded Matt Smith in the role after the 2013 Christmas episode, \"The Time of the Doctor.\""

      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage:\n\n1.  \nThe international growth of ABC took off for a second time during the 1990s with ESPN's global expansion and was further driven in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks. During this period, Disney grew its American cable networks like Disney Channel, Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix abroad, although it also sold its 33% share in the European sports network Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000. Unlike Disney’s other channels, ABC is mainly broadcast in the U.S., though its shows are syndicated globally. The idea of fully-owned international networks was revisited in 2004 when ABC launched ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the UK. However, Disney ended ABC1’s operation in October 2007 due to low viewer numbers, effectively putting an end to efforts at developing an overseas ABC network.\n\n2.  \nABC experienced another stage of global expansion in the 1990s due in part to ESPN’s reach, later enhanced by Disney Media Networks’ strategies in the 2000s. While Disney expanded its American networks such as the Disney Channel and its related offshoots internationally, it also sold a significant interest in Eurosport, exiting with $155 million in June 2000. Although ABC broadcasts exclusively in the U.S., its programs are distributed in several foreign markets. The attempt to operate fully owned channels internationally reemerged in 2004 with the launch of ABC1 in the UK, but after failing to gain a steady audience, the channel was closed in October 2007, ending these international ambitions.\n\n3.  \nIn the 1990s, ABC began a second wave of international expansion, particularly through the ESPN network. This continued into the 2000s as Disney Media Networks pushed to grow Disney’s American cable channels—such as Disney Channel and its spin-offs—while also pulling back in Europe by selling a 33% stake in Eurosport for $155 million in mid-2000. Whereas ABC is primarily a U.S. network, its shows are also syndicated overseas. The idea of launching fully owned international channels resurfaced in 2004 with ABC1’s debut in the UK, but the channel was shut down in October 2007 due to low viewership, and efforts to create an ABC International presence were halted.\n\n4.  \nA second international expansion for ABC occurred thanks to ESPN’s growth in the 1990s and new strategies by Disney Media Networks in the 2000s, which saw U.S. channels like Disney Channel and its subsidiaries extend their reach. At the same time, Disney sold off its 33% stake in Eurosport in June 2000 for $155 million. ABC itself is only broadcast domestically, though its content is licensed worldwide. Disney returned to the idea of owning international networks in 2004 with the UK-based ABC1 channel, but after struggling to draw viewers, ABC1 was discontinued in late 2007, closing the chapter on ABC’s direct international broadcast efforts.\n\nLet me know if you need more options or further simplifications!",
      "1.  \nDuring the 1990s, American Broadcasting Company (ABC) experienced a second phase of international growth alongside ESPN’s global expansion. In the 2000s, Disney Media Networks—parent to ABC—further extended several of its U.S. cable channels internationally, including Disney Channel, Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix. Around this time, Disney also sold its 33% share in the European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000. Unlike Disney's cable networks, ABC itself mainly broadcasts in the U.S., though its shows are syndicated worldwide. The approach towards fully owned international channels resumed in 2004 when ABC launched ABC1, a free U.K. channel. However, due to low ratings, ABC1 was discontinued in October 2007, and efforts to establish ABC as an international channel were halted.\n\n2.  \nABC’s second wave of global expansion began in the 1990s, coinciding with the overseas growth of ESPN. The 2000s brought new initiatives by Disney Media Networks, which expanded its main U.S. cable networks—such as Disney Channel and its derivatives—internationally, although it sold its 33% stake in the European sports network Eurosport in June 2000 for $155 million. While Disney’s various channels spread abroad, ABC's main operations remained American, with only its programs distributed to other countries. In 2004, the company revived its strategy of owning entire international channels by launching ABC1 in the United Kingdom. However, due to a lack of high viewership, ABC1 was shut down in October 2007, and the company ceased attempts at an international ABC network.\n\n3.  \nAmerican Broadcasting Company saw another period of international outreach in the 1990s, tied closely to ESPN’s expansion overseas. In the 2000s, Disney Media Networks pushed several U.S.-based channels, such as Disney Channel and its spinoffs, into new markets, even as the company sold its interest in Eurosport for $155 million in mid-2000. Unlike those channels, ABC continued to primarily broadcast in the United States, though its content reached many different countries through syndication. The idea of creating wholly owned foreign channels was revived when ABC1 launched in the UK in 2004, but this venture ended by late 2007 after Disney cited unsustainable viewer numbers, marking the end of ABC's efforts to build an international presence.",
      "1. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) underwent a second phase of international expansion that paralleled the growth of the ESPN network in the 1990s and new strategies set forth by Disney Media Networks in the 2000s. These strategies included growing several U.S.-based cable channels like Disney Channel and its offshoots—Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix. Notably, Disney also sold its 33% share of Eurosport, a European sports channel, for $155 million in June 2000. Unlike Disney’s other channels, ABC primarily airs in the United States, though its programs are syndicated worldwide. The idea of launching fully owned international ABC networks was rekindled in 2004 when ABC1, a free UK channel, was introduced. However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced ABC1 would be discontinued due to low viewership, marking the end of the company's efforts to create ABC International with the channel’s closure in October.\n\n2. ABC's journey towards international expansion entered a new chapter in the 1990s alongside ESPN’s growth, fueled by Disney’s media policies in the following decade. These policies saw Disney expand its domestic cable offerings—such as the Disney Channel and related networks—while also selling its 33% interest in Eurosport for $155 million in 2000. While ABC broadcasts exclusively in the US, its shows reach audiences across many countries through syndication. In 2004, Disney revived its ambition for internationally owned stations by launching ABC1 in the UK, only to close it in October 2007 after failing to build a sustainable audience, thus ending plans for an ABC International network.\n\n3. The American Broadcasting Company experienced its second round of international growth in line with ESPN’s worldwide expansion in the 1990s and new Disney Media Networks initiatives in the 2000s. Among these was the growth of various U.S. cable networks, like Disney Channel, Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix; Disney also divested its 33% holding in the European channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000. Unlike other Disney networks, ABC operates primarily in the U.S., but its content is available globally via syndication. An attempt to launch ABC-branded channels overseas was made in 2004 with the introduction of ABC1 in the UK. Despite this, low viewership led Disney to close ABC1 in October 2007, bringing their international ambitions for ABC to a halt.\n\n4. In the 1990s, ABC’s international presence grew alongside ESPN, further propelled in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks’ expansion policies, which included broadening U.S.-based cable channels such as Disney Channel and its subsidiaries. Disney also sold its minority share in Eurosport for $155 million in mid-2000. ABC, in contrast to some Disney channels, is meant for the U.S. audience, but its shows are seen worldwide through syndication deals. Disney tried to revive its creation of fully owned international networks in 2004 with ABC1, a UK channel, but the network ended in 2007 due to poor audience numbers, bringing the ABC International experiment to an end.",
      "1.  \nIn the 1990s, the American Broadcasting Company began a new phase of international growth linked to the ESPN network, followed by Disney Media Networks' initiatives in the 2000s.

At the same time, Disney sold its 33% share in Eurosport, a European sports channel, for $155 million in June 2000. Unlike Disney’s other channels, ABC primarily broadcasts in the United States, although its shows are syndicated internationally. The idea of fully owned international networks returned in 2004 when ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the UK, was launched by the ABC Group. However, Disney decided to close ABC1 on September 8, 2007, due to low ratings, thus ending efforts to expand ABC on a global scale when the channel formally shut down the following month.\n\n2.  \nABC’s international activities saw renewed vigor in the 1990s alongside ESPN’s overseas expansion, and further through Disney Media Networks’ strategies in the 2000s, which grew multiple U.S.-based cable networks including the Disney Channel and its related channels. While doing so, Disney divested from Eurosport, selling its 33% share for $155 million in June 2000. ABC, in contrast to Disney’s other properties, is a U.S.-focused broadcaster but does allow its programming to be shown internationally through syndication. The concept of international ABC networks reemerged in 2004 with the announcement and release of ABC1 in the UK. Nonetheless, low audience numbers led Disney to announce ABC1's closure in September 2007, officially bringing the company’s push for an ABC International network to a close the following month.\n\n3.  \nThe 1990s marked a renewed push for international expansion at the American Broadcasting Company, particularly with ESPN’s global growth, followed by Disney Media Networks' furthering in the 2000s by increasing the reach of several U.S.-origin networks like Disney Channel, Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix. In 2000, Disney also sold its 33% interest in the European network Eurosport for $155 million. Unlike most Disney channels, ABC itself is mainly a domestic broadcaster, though its programs air in other countries via syndication. Attempts to operate an international ABC network resurfaced in 2004 with the UK launch of ABC1. Still, by September 2007, Disney announced ABC1 would be discontinued due to insufficient viewership, and with its closure in October, the ABC International project was abandoned.\n\n4.  \nABC’s second wave of internationalization began with ESPN’s worldwide expansion in the 1990s and accelerated in the 2000s through Disney Media Networks’ initiatives, which included extending Disney Channel and several of its spin-offs. Despite this, Disney sold its one-third stake in the European sports broadcaster Eurosport for $155 million in mid-2000. While ABC is broadcast mainly in the U.S., its content reaches global audiences via syndication. In 2004, ABC tried again to establish an international presence by opening ABC1 in the United Kingdom. However, after struggling to attract enough viewers, Disney closed ABC1 in October 2007, bringing an end to the effort to globalize the ABC network.",

Unlike Disney’s other channels, ABC itself broadcasts primarily in the U.S., though its shows are syndicated overseas. The idea of launching wholly owned international networks resurfaced in 2004, when ABC introduced ABC1, a free-to-air British channel. Nevertheless, Disney announced in September 2007 that ABC1 would close due to low audience numbers, ending its attempts at developing ABC International when the channel shuttered the following month.\n\n2.  \nThe 1990s saw the American Broadcasting Company enter another wave of global expansion through ESPN, a trend continued in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks, which grew numerous U.S. cable networks like Disney Channel and spinoffs such as Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney, and Jetix. Meanwhile, Disney divested its 33% stake in Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000. While Disney’s networks typically target international markets, ABC primarily serves the U.S., but syndicates its content worldwide. Disney revived its strategy to launch wholly owned foreign networks in 2004 by starting ABC1 in the UK.

      "1.  \nNewton’s Third Law emerges from the concept of symmetry when analyzing forces between objects. According to this law, every force results from an interaction involving at least two bodies, which means forces never act solely on a single object. If one object applies a force F on another, the second object instantly applies a force -F on the first. These two forces are equal in size but opposite in direction. This principle, often known as the action-reaction law, labels F as the “action” and -F as the equally-timed “reaction”.\n\n2.  \nNewton’s Third Law states that forces are always the result of interactions between objects—there are no forces that affect only one body. When one object exerts a force F on another, that second object exerts a force of -F back on the first. These forces are always equal in strength and opposite in direction. This is frequently summarized as the action-reaction law, meaning the action (F) and the reaction (−F) occur at the same time.\n\n3.  \nBy applying the idea of symmetry, Newton’s Third Law reveals that forces always involve interactions between two objects. There can never be a one-way force acting on only one object. When a force F is exerted by one object on another, the second object simultaneously applies a force of -F on the first. Both are equal and opposite. Often, this is called the action-reaction law, with the two forces occurring at the same instant and countering each other.",
      "1.  \nNewton's Third Law states that forces always occur in pairs, as a result of symmetry when multiple objects interact. This law tells us that all forces are mutual interactions—there cannot be a force acting on just one object without an equal and opposite force acting in return. If one object applies a force F to another, then that second object instantly applies an equal and opposite force, −F, to the first. These paired forces are known as \"action\" and \"reaction,\" and they happen at the same time.\n\n2.  \nAccording to Newton's Third Law, force is something that exists only as an interaction between objects, not as something that acts on just one object alone. The law says that whenever one object exerts a force, F, on another, the second object responds with a force of −F back on the first. Both forces are the same size but point in opposite directions. This is why the law is also known as the action-reaction principle, emphasizing that these effects occur together and are inseparable.\n\n3.  \nNewton’s Third Law arises from the principle of symmetry in physical interactions. It asserts that every force is the result of two bodies interacting, so there is no such thing as a one-sided force. Specifically, when body one applies a force F to body two, body two applies a force of −F on body one at the same moment. These forces, named action and reaction, are always equal in size and opposite in direction, and both occur simultaneously.",
      "1.  \nNewton's Third Law stems from applying symmetry to situations involving forces between objects. It states that all forces are the result of interactions between two bodies, and thus, there cannot be a force that acts solely on one object. When one body applies a force F to another, the second body simultaneously applies an equal but opposite force −F to the first. These forces are equal in size and opposite in direction, a relationship often described as the action-reaction law, where F is the \"action\" and −F is the \"reaction.\" Both occur at the same instant.\n\n2.  \nAccording to Newton's Third Law, which relies on symmetry, forces always arise from interactions between different objects; there is no such thing as a one-way force that affects only a single body. If the first object applies a force F to a second object, the second object will always apply an equal and opposite force −F to the first. These action and reaction forces happen at the same time and have the same size but opposite directions.\n\n3.  \nNewton's Third Law, based on symmetry, tells us that every force is due to an interaction between two bodies—no force acts on only one object. If object one exerts a force F on object two, object two exerts a force −F on object one at the same moment. The forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, called action and reaction.\n\n4.  \nNewton's Third Law results from the symmetry found in force interactions between objects, stating that a force always comes in pairs acting on two different bodies. For example, when one object pushes on another with force F, the second object pushes back with force −F, equal in strength but opposite in direction. This is known as the action-reaction law, with the two forces occurring at the same time.\n\n5.  \nWhen analyzing how forces work, Newton's Third Law—derived from symmetry—shows that forces always involve two objects and work in pairs, never as a single isolated force. That means if you push on something, it pushes back with exactly the same amount of force in the opposite direction. We call one the \"action\" and the other the \"reaction,\" and both happen instantly together.",

The Eighth Doctor's TV movie used a revised version of the logo that originated with the Third Doctor. From 1973 to 1980, a particular logo distinguished the Third Doctor's last season and most of the Fourth Doctor's episodes. The next logo, though closely linked with the Fifth Doctor, was actually introduced during the Fourth Doctor’s final season. The Ninth Doctor’s logo required only minor edits for the Tenth Doctor, maintaining a similar style. For the Eleventh Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol was shifted to the right in 2012, but while the font stayed consistent, its texture was updated each episode to match the story. In the Twelfth Doctor’s era, the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol was dropped, and the logo’s font was subtly refined and made a bit larger.

From 1973 through 1980, a specific logo was prominent during the final season of the Third Doctor and for most of the Fourth Doctor's stories. The subsequent logo, though usually tied to the Fifth Doctor, also made its debut in the Fourth Doctor's final run. For the Ninth Doctor, the existing logo was only slightly revised for the Tenth Doctor. With the Eleventh Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia was positioned on the right side in 2012, with the font mostly unchanged but the texture being refreshed to reflect each episode’s narrative. The Twelfth Doctor’s logo omitted the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol, made the font a little bigger, and altered it subtly. Since 2014, the historically iconic logo from the Third and Eighth Doctors has been used for all legacy Doctor merchandise, while merchandise for the current Doctor features the latest version of the logo.\n\n3.  \nFor the First Doctor, and briefly the Second, the show’s original logo was used, and this design appeared again in a slightly updated form for the Eleventh Doctor’s 50th anniversary special, \"The Day of the Doctor.\" The Eighth Doctor’s movie used a revised version of the Third Doctor's logo. Between 1973 and 1980, a distinctive logo was used during the Third Doctor’s concluding series and through much of the Fourth Doctor’s tenure. The next logo is most linked to the Fifth Doctor, though it originated during the final season of the Fourth. The logo for the Ninth Doctor was only minimally altered for his successor, the Tenth Doctor. With the Eleventh Doctor, the TARDIS-shaped \"DW\" logo was moved to the right in 2012, with minor font changes and a new story-related texture each episode. The Twelfth Doctor's era dropped the \"DW\" symbol and introduced a slightly enlarged and refined font.

During the Eleventh Doctor’s series, the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia appeared to the right of the logo starting in 2012, but the font stayed mostly the same, changing texture in each episode to fit the story theme. With the Twelfth Doctor’s era, the \"DW\" TARDIS was dropped, the font was slightly tweaked, and enlarged. Since 2014, the logo from the Third and Eighth Doctors is used on all media and products related to past Doctors, while the current Doctor always gets their own unique logo on new merchandise.\n\n2.  \nThe initial Doctor Who logo was introduced with the First Doctor and briefly used by the Second, then brought back in a revised form for the Eleventh Doctor’s 50th anniversary episode.

The subsequent logo, commonly tied to the Fifth Doctor, also closed the Fourth Doctor’s tenure. The Tenth Doctor’s logo was only slightly altered from the Ninth Doctor’s version. The Eleventh Doctor’s era added a \"DW\" TARDIS icon to the logo in 2012, maintaining the font but giving it episode-specific textures that echoed each story. For the Twelfth Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS element was dropped, the font was subtly adjusted, and sized up a bit. Since 2014, the Third and Eighth Doctors’ logo is featured on legacy merchandise and media, while contemporary items use the logo of the current Doctor.\n\n3.  \nDoctor Who’s logo has evolved alongside the show. The original design, first used for the First and briefly Second Doctor, reappeared in an updated style during the Eleventh Doctor’s 50th anniversary special. The Eighth Doctor’s movie logo drew inspiration from the Third Doctor’s. A logo from the 1970s spanned late Third Doctor and almost all of the Fourth Doctor’s episodes. The next logo had its debut in the Fourth Doctor’s last season but is mostly linked to the Fifth Doctor. The visual identity for the Tenth Doctor was a minor update of the Ninth Doctor’s logo, staying largely consistent. The Eleventh Doctor’s logo gained a “DW” shaped like the TARDIS in 2012, its font remaining but with different textures relating to episode themes. With the arrival of the Twelfth Doctor, the “DW” TARDIS emblem was removed, the font refined and made a bit larger. Today, the logo tied to the Third and Eighth Doctors appears on merchandise for historic Doctors, and the incumbent Doctor’s logo appears on current release products.\n\n4.  \nAcross Doctor Who history, the show’s logo has seen several changes. The logo first introduced for the First Doctor, and briefly utilized for the Second, was reused with some alterations for \"The Day of the Doctor\" during the Eleventh Doctor’s series. The Eighth Doctor’s TV movie employed a modernized Third Doctor logo, while the Third Doctor’s last season and most of the Fourth Doctor’s era used the 1973–80 design. The subsequent logo, although best recognized with the Fifth Doctor, was also present for the final Fourth Doctor season. From the Ninth to Tenth Doctors, the logo underwent only minor changes in appearance. The Eleventh Doctor’s logo included a new \"DW\" TARDIS symbol in 2012, but the base font only had slight, episode-specific edits. The Twelfth Doctor’s era removed the \"DW\" TARDIS and updated the font, increasing its size a bit.

The logo present from 1973 to 1980 appeared during the Third Doctor’s final series and most of the Fourth Doctor’s time.

For the Eleventh Doctor, the logo included the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol on its right from 2012, keeping the same font but tweaking the texture for each episode, reflecting elements from the story. When the Twelfth Doctor took over, the \"DW\" TARDIS icon was dropped and the font was subtly adjusted and enlarged. Since 2014, the logo first used for the Third and Eighth Doctors has been the main emblem for classic Doctor merchandise, while new Doctor Who products use the latest logo.\n\n2.  \nDoctor Who’s logo has evolved through the years, often reflecting the era of each Doctor.

The subsequent logo, though mainly tied to the Fifth Doctor, also appeared in the Fourth Doctor’s last season. When the Tenth Doctor arrived, the Ninth Doctor’s logo remained but was slightly touched up. The Eleventh Doctor’s era brought a textured logo that changed each episode, with the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia added in 2012. For the Twelfth Doctor, the \"DW\" symbol was removed, and the font received subtle tweaks. Beginning in 2014, Doctor Who merchandise for classic Doctors uses the Third and Eighth Doctor logo, whereas current Doctor items use the contemporary logo.\n\n3.  \nThrough its history, Doctor Who has featured various logos tied to different Doctors. The original logo, designed for the First and briefly Second Doctor, saw a revival with minor edits in the 50th anniversary Eleventh Doctor episode, \"The Day of the Doctor.\" An updated Third Doctor logo appeared in the movie starring the Eighth Doctor. From 1973 to 1980, a particular logo was present for the last season of the Third Doctor and most of the Fourth Doctor’s stint. The following logo is mainly connected to the Fifth Doctor but was also used for the closing season of the Fourth. The Ninth Doctor’s logo slightly changed to suit the Tenth Doctor. The Eleventh Doctor's logo included the \"DW\" TARDIS emblem on the right from 2012 and adapted its texture every episode to match the story. For the Twelfth Doctor, the \"DW\" symbol disappeared and the font grew subtly larger.

The First Doctor’s original logo, reused for the Second Doctor for a short time, came back in altered form for the Eleventh Doctor’s 50th anniversary special, \"The Day of the Doctor.\" The Eighth Doctor’s movie featured a modernized version of the Third Doctor’s logo. The 1973–80 design accompanied the final series of the Third Doctor and much of the Fourth’s. Later, a logo mainly associated with the Fifth Doctor also capped off the Fourth’s tenure. The Ninth Doctor's logo only received slight adjustments for the Tenth. For the Eleventh Doctor, the addition of the \"DW\" TARDIS icon on the right began in 2012, with the font’s texture changing per episode to reflect story elements. Upon the arrival of the Twelfth Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol was omitted and the logo font was made just slightly larger and refined.

From 1973 to 1980, the same logo appeared in the Third Doctor’s last season and for most of the Fourth Doctor’s run. The subsequent logo, mainly linked to the Fifth Doctor, was also applied in the Fourth Doctor’s final season. When the Ninth Doctor’s logo transitioned to the Tenth Doctor, it received only minor tweaks, keeping the overall look. The Eleventh Doctor’s logo initially sported a \"DW\" TARDIS icon, which was positioned to the right in 2012, and the texture of the logo changed subtly in each episode to reflect the story. For the Twelfth Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol was dropped, and the font was slightly updated and made larger.

Between 1973 and 1980, a single logo spanned the final Third Doctor stories and most of the Fourth Doctor’s episodes, with the next logo mostly connected to the Fifth Doctor, though used at the end of the Fourth’s era as well. The Ninth Doctor’s logo was modestly adjusted for the Tenth Doctor, maintaining a similar overall appearance. The Eleventh Doctor’s version added a \"DW\" TARDIS emblem, moved to the right in 2012, and each episode altered the logo’s texture to relate to its storyline. With the Twelfth Doctor, the logo dropped the \"DW\" TARDIS mark and featured a somewhat larger, subtly refined font. Since 2014, media and merchandise for earlier Doctors mainly feature the Third/Eighth Doctor logo, while current Doctor merchandising uses whatever logo the latest series adopts.\n\n3.  \nDoctor Who’s original logo, used with the First and briefly the Second Doctor, was revived in a tweaked version for the 50th anniversary special that aired with the Eleventh Doctor. The Eighth Doctor’s TV movie logo was a modernized variant of the Third Doctor’s emblem. From 1973 to 1980, one particular logo featured through the Third Doctor’s closing season and much of the Fourth’s, before transitioning to another logo for the Fifth Doctor—which also appeared at the end of the Fourth Doctor era. The Ninth Doctor’s logo, only minimally modified, was handed down to the Tenth Doctor. With the Eleventh Doctor, a \"DW\" TARDIS insignia was added (and later shifted right in 2012), while the logo’s texture would change slightly each episode to reference the plot. The Twelfth Doctor saw the TARDIS icon removed and the font enlarged and refined. Since 2014, the main logo for legacy Doctor Who content is the one once used by the Third and Eighth Doctors, whereas merchandise for the current Doctor always uses the latest show logo.\n\n4.  \nThe original Doctor Who logo—first used for the First Doctor and briefly for the Second—was reintroduced in a reworked form during the Eleventh Doctor’s tenure for \"The Day of the Doctor,\" the show’s 50th anniversary episode. The logo for the Eighth Doctor’s TV film updated the Third Doctor’s logo. Between 1973 and 1980, the same design was seen in the Third Doctor’s last season and most of the Fourth Doctor’s. The next design, strongly associated with the Fifth Doctor, also made an appearance during the Fourth Doctor’s final stories. The Ninth Doctor’s logo was only slightly changed for the Tenth, keeping its recognizable look. The Eleventh Doctor’s logo included a \"DW\" TARDIS mark, which in 2012 was moved to the right, and the logo itself shifted in texture from episode to episode to match story elements. For the Twelfth Doctor, the \"DW\" TARDIS mark disappeared and the text was enlarged and subtly adjusted. By 2014, the logo from the eras of the Third and Eighth Doctors became the standard for classic Doctor merchandise and media, while current merchandise uses the up-to-date series logo.",
      "1. The initial logo for Doctor Who, first seen with the First Doctor and briefly with the Second Doctor, was modified and reused for the 50th anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" during the time of the Eleventh Doctor. The logo from the TV movie featuring the Eighth Doctor was a modernized version of the one used in the Third Doctor’s era. The 1973–80 logo was displayed during the Third Doctor’s last season and persisted through most of the Fourth Doctor’s episodes. The logo most commonly linked to the Fifth Doctor was also present in the Fourth Doctor’s final episodes. The Ninth Doctor’s logo was slightly tweaked for the Tenth Doctor, keeping a consistent look. During the Eleventh Doctor’s run, the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol appeared to the right in 2012, though the font and its texture, which changed slightly for each story, remained mostly the same. For the Twelfth Doctor, the \"DW\" insignia was removed, the font was refined, and increased in size. Since 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the main one for past Doctor merchandise, while the current series uses its contemporary logo for the current Doctor.\n\n2. Doctor Who’s original logo, introduced with the First and briefly the Second Doctor, was brought back with slight changes for the 50th anniversary episode \"The Day of the Doctor\" under the Eleventh Doctor. The Eighth Doctor’s TV movie showcased an updated logo based on the Third Doctor’s version. The emblem from 1973 to 1980 was present during the Third Doctor’s last stint and dominated most of the Fourth Doctor’s run. The next logo, typically tied to the Fifth Doctor, also appeared at the end of the Fourth Doctor’s era. There was only a minor alteration to the Ninth Doctor’s logo for the Tenth Doctor, maintaining its overall appearance. The Eleventh Doctor’s logo added a \"DW\" TARDIS mark on the right in 2012, and although the font stayed, the texture changed with each episode to match the story. When the Twelfth Doctor arrived, the \"DW\" TARDIS was dropped, the lettering was subtly changed, and its size was increased. As of 2014, the Third and Eighth Doctors’ logo became standard for earlier Doctors' merchandise, while current products feature the latest series logo.\n\n3. The Doctor Who logo that debuted with the First Doctor, and briefly for the Second, showed up in a revised form during the Eleventh Doctor's tenure for \"The Day of the Doctor\" anniversary special. The Eighth Doctor’s television film used an updated iteration of the Third Doctor’s logo. Between 1973 and 1980, another logo was used at the end of the Third Doctor’s time and throughout most of the Fourth Doctor’s episodes. The logo usually linked to the Fifth Doctor also marked the end of the Fourth Doctor’s period. For the Tenth Doctor, the Ninth Doctor’s logo was only changed slightly, keeping its main design. The Eleventh Doctor’s series updated the logo by moving the \"DW\" TARDIS symbol to the right in 2012, and each episode featured a unique texture on the unchanged font to suit its story. In the Twelfth Doctor’s era, the \"DW\" mark disappeared, and the font was both subtly refined and made larger. Since 2014, merchandise about past Doctors uses the Third/Eighth Doctor logo as a standard, while items for the current Doctor use the newest logo."

      "**Rewritten passage 1:**  \nIn the United Methodist Church, there is a role called the lay servant. Lay servants are not clergy, but they sometimes lead worship services and deliver sermons when ordained ministers or deacons are not available. There are two types: local church lay servants, who serve in their own congregations, and certified lay servants, who may serve in other churches and take part in larger church-related projects. To become a local church lay servant, a person needs a recommendation from their pastor and church council, and must complete a basic course. This status requires an annual reapplication, with a report on their service and learning. Certified lay servants must also be recommended, complete both a basic and an advanced course, and pass an interview with a district committee. They must reapply each year and complete an advanced course at least every three years.\n\n**Rewritten passage 2:**  \nWithin the United Methodist Church, lay servants play an important part despite not being considered part of the clergy. They are called upon to preach when ordained leaders are unavailable. Lay servants fall into two groups: local church lay servants, who serve within their home church, and certified lay servants, who can serve more broadly. To qualify as a local church lay servant, one must get endorsements from both their pastor and church council, finish the basic lay servant course, and reapply annually with a record of their activities and learning. Certified lay servants, in addition, must complete an advanced course, undergo an interview with a higher committee, report and reapply every year, and take an advanced course at least once every three years.\n\n**Rewritten passage 3:**  \nThe United Methodist Church designates some members as lay servants, who are laypeople that help lead worship when ordained ministers are not present. Lay servants include local church lay servants, who serve in their own congregations, and certified lay servants, who may serve elsewhere or participate in larger church initiatives. Becoming a local church lay servant requires a pastor and council’s recommendation and completion of a basic course, with annual renewal needed. Certified lay servants must fulfill those requirements plus an advanced course and an interview, and they must continue their training by taking advanced courses every three years.",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the original passage, each phrased differently:\n\n1.  \nIn the United Methodist Church, an important non-clergy role is that of the lay servant. Lay speakers, while not ordained, often fill in to lead worship services when no elder, Local Pastor, Associate Member, or deacon is available. Lay servants are classified as either local church lay servants, who serve within their home churches, or certified lay servants, who may serve their own as well as other churches, and participate in wider district or conference initiatives. Local church lay servants must be recommended by both their pastor and church council or charge conference, and they are required to complete a basic training course. Annual reapplication and a report on their service and learning are also expected. Certified lay servants, on the other hand, must complete both the basic and an advanced lay servant course, receive recommendations, and undergo an interview with a committee. They must reapply every year and take at least one advanced course every three years.\n\n2.  \nThe United Methodist Church has a role called lay servant, which, though not ordained clergy, allows individuals to lead worship and preach when ministers aren't available. There are two types: local church lay servants, who serve only within their own church, and certified lay servants, who can also help in other churches and participate in church projects. To become a local church lay servant, a person needs their pastor’s support, church council approval, and completion of a basic course. They must reapply and document their progress each year. Certified lay servants need to finish both basic and advanced courses, get recommendations, and be interviewed by a church committee. They report annually and must complete an advanced course every three years.\n\n3.  \nWithin the United Methodist Church, the lay servant position allows non-clergy members to assist with worship services, especially in the absence of ordained leadership. Lay servants may be designated as local church lay servants, who primarily work within their home congregation, or as certified lay servants, who can also serve in various churches and district events. To become a local church lay servant, recommendation from church leadership and successful completion of a basic course are required, as well as annual renewal based on their service and learning. Certified lay servants need similar endorsements, but must also complete an advanced course and be interviewed by a committee, in addition to meeting annual and triennial requirements for continuing education.\n\n4.  \nIn the United Methodist Church, besides ordained clergy, lay servants also hold key responsibilities such as delivering sermons when needed. Two types exist: local church lay servants, who serve only in their own church, and certified lay servants, who may also serve in other congregations and support district or conference programs. Becoming a lay servant involves pastoral recommendation, church council approval, and necessary training. To remain recognized, lay servants must report their activities and seek re-approval every year. Certified lay servants have additional requirements, such as interviews and ongoing advanced coursework.",
      "Sure! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage:\n\n1.  \nThe United Methodist Church also has lay servants, who are not clergy but may deliver sermons when no ordained minister, Local Pastor, Associate Member, or deacon is present. Lay servants are divided into two groups: local church lay servants—who work within their own congregations—and certified lay servants—who can serve in multiple churches as well as in district or conference initiatives. Local church lay servants must be endorsed by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, complete a basic lay servant course, and reapply annually with a report of their service and learning. Certified lay servants need to be recommended, take both basic and advanced courses, be interviewed by a committee, and report every year, plus complete an advanced course every three years.\n\n2.  \nWithin the United Methodist Church, the role of lay servant exists for those who, while not clergy, lead worship and occasionally preach if an ordained leader is unavailable. There are local church lay servants—serving only in their own congregations—and certified lay servants—who can serve throughout the wider church. Local lay servants must be recommended and complete a foundational course, then reapply each year after reporting their activities. Certified lay servants go through a similar process, but must also complete an interview and advanced training periodically.\n\n3.  \nLay servants in the United Methodist Church assist by providing leadership during worship when ordained ministers aren’t available. Two kinds are recognized: those serving solely in their own churches (local church lay servants), and those serving in multiple settings, including district and conference events (certified lay servants). Becoming a local church lay servant requires church approval and a basic training course, with yearly reviews. Certified lay servants need more training, a committee interview, and must continue advanced education regularly to maintain their status.",

To become a local church lay servant, a person must be recommended by their pastor and local governing body, and finish a basic lay servant course. They must also reapply each year, documenting their service and ongoing education. Certified lay servants, in addition to these requirements, must complete an advanced course and have an interview with the District or Conference Committee on Lay Speaking. They also need to reapply annually and take an advanced course at least every three years.\n\n2.  \nThe United Methodist Church also offers the position of lay servant to its members. Though lay servants are not part of the clergy, they can give sermons when no ordained minister is present. There are two levels: local church lay servant (serving only their own church) and certified lay servant (serving their church, other churches, and district or conference activities). To become a local church lay servant, one must be nominated by their pastor and church leadership, complete a basic lay servant course, and renew their status every year by providing a report. For certification, candidates need additional advanced coursework and an interview with the district or conference, plus ongoing education and yearly renewal.\n\n3.  \nWithin the United Methodist Church, lay servant is a position assigned to non-clergy members who may sometimes deliver sermons when ordained leaders are unavailable. Lay servants can be either local church lay servants, who operate within their own congregations, or certified lay servants, who may work in other churches or on broader projects. Prospective local church lay servants must be recommended, finish a basic course, and submit an annual report for re-approval. Certified lay servants are also required to complete an advanced course and are interviewed by a committee; they must also continue their training and renew their certification annually.\n\n4.  \nIn the United Methodist Church, lay servants—who are not clergy—occasionally preach if there is no ordained minister present. There are two main types: local church lay servants, who focus on serving in their own church, and certified lay servants, who can serve across various churches and in district activities. To become a local lay servant requires a recommendation and completion of a basic training course, followed by yearly renewal with a service report.

The widespread adoption of internet technology in recent years has begun to change the teaching profession and classroom practices.\n\n4.  \nWhether through structured courses or more casual lessons, teachers aim to teach students key skills and concepts, a practice known as pedagogy. In choosing how to teach, they factor in what students already know, the class environment, their educational goals, and requirements set by curriculum authorities. Teachers sometimes enhance student learning by bringing them on field trips. Additionally, the rapid rise of the internet over the past ten years has started to reshape teaching methods and roles."

Martin Luther, in his arguments against the antinomians, reiterates the importance of the \"second use of the law.\" This is the idea that the law serves as an instrument of the Holy Spirit to produce sorrow for sin in people, making them ready to receive Christ’s fulfillment of the law through the gospel. Luther explains that anything evoking sorrow over sin is considered the law—whether it’s Christ’s life, His death for humanity’s sins, or even the experience of God’s goodness in creation. Therefore, simply choosing not to preach the Ten Commandments within the church doesn’t erase the law’s accusing power. Saying that no form of the law should be preached to Christians would be like claiming Christians are free from sin and that the church is made up only of perfectly holy people.\n\n2. In his disputes with antinomians, Martin Luther stresses the “second use of the law”—that the law acts as the Spirit’s tool to create remorse for sin, readying people for the gospel’s promise of Christ fulfilling the law. He maintains that any means causing awareness of sin is functionally the law, whether it comes from the story of Christ’s life, His sacrificial death, or the blessings of creation. Thus, eliminating the Ten Commandments from church sermons does not remove the presence or the work of the law. To suggest Christians no longer need to hear the law is to claim they have no more sin and that the church is a gathering of flawless individuals.\n\n3. When addressing the antinomians, Luther upholds what is known as the law’s “second use”—its role, through the Spirit, of convicting people of sin and guiding them toward Christ’s redemption. Luther regards anything that sparks sorrow over wrongdoing, whether it stems from Christ’s actions, His death, or the goodness found in creation, as fulfilling the law’s purpose. He argues that refraining from teaching the Ten Commandments does not make the law disappear from the lives of believers. Insisting that the law has no place in Christian preaching effectively denies that Christians still struggle with sin and suggests that the church is made up only of entirely saintly people.",

Luther notes that anything that brings about sorrow for sin—even if it is Christ’s life, His death, or God’s kindness in creation—can be considered the law. He argues that simply not preaching the Ten Commandments among Christians does not get rid of the law’s accusatory role. To say that the law should never be preached to Christians is, according to Luther, essentially to claim that Christians are no longer sinners and that the church is made up entirely of holy people.\n\n**2**  \nAccording to Luther’s theses opposing the antinomians, he upholds the “second use of the law,” which refers to how the law convicts people of their sin through the Holy Spirit, thereby preparing them for Christ’s saving work in the gospel. Luther asserts that whatever brings people to feel sorrow over their sin is considered the law—even events like Christ’s sacrificial death or the experience of God's goodness in nature. He insists that refusing to preach the Ten Commandments in the church does not actually remove the law’s accusatory function. Luther argues that saying Christians should no longer hear about the law is like saying Christians have stopped being sinners and the church is only for the perfectly holy.\n\n**3**  \nLuther, when challenging the antinomians, restates the concept known as the “second use of the law,” in which the law—by the Holy Spirit’s power—creates remorse over sin and thus opens hearts to Christ’s fulfillment of the law in the gospel.

Merely excluding the Ten Commandments from church teaching does not erase the law’s accusatory voice. For Luther, claiming the law should not be taught to Christians is equivalent to claiming Christians have no more sin and the church is made up only of saints.\n\n**4**  \nIn his disputes with the antinomians, Luther defends the idea that the law, in its “second use,” serves as a tool for the Holy Spirit to induce sorrow for sin in human hearts. This sorrow readies people for Christ, who has fulfilled the law and is presented in the gospel. Luther says that anything leading to sorrow for sin is considered the law, whether it is Jesus's actions, his sacrificial death, or the blessing of creation. Simply choosing not to speak about the Ten Commandments to Christians does not remove the effect of the law's accusation.

Luther argues that anything that produces sorrow over sin qualifies as \"law,\" whether it be Christ's life, His death for human transgressions, or the experience of God's goodness in creation. Luther also asserts that refusing to preach the Ten Commandments in the church, or metaphorically removing the word \"law,\" doesn’t actually get rid of the law’s accusatory function. To claim that the law should never be proclaimed to Christians is, according to Luther, to wrongly suggest that Christians are no longer sinners and that the church is made up only of perfectly holy people.\n\n**2.**  \nMartin Luther, while debating antinomians, reflects on and upholds the concept described as the \"second use of the law.\" This refers to the law’s role in working through the Holy Spirit to create an awareness of sin, ultimately leading a person to Christ and the offer of salvation through the gospel. He maintains that any means which brings about remorse for sin is considered the law, including Christ’s own life, sacrifice, and even the blessings of creation. Luther cautions that simply choosing not to teach the Ten Commandments among Christians does not erase the accusing nature of the law. To say the law is no longer relevant to Christians is, he argues, to deny the ongoing sinfulness of believers and to claim, falsely, that the church is only made up of inherently holy individuals.\n\n**3.**  \nWhen refuting the views of the antinomians, Luther reiterates the principle of the \"second use of the law\"—that the law is employed by the Holy Spirit to awaken repentance in people’s hearts, thus turning them towards Christ’s redemptive work in the gospel. He points out that whatever brings about awareness and sorrow for sin is called the law, which can include not only the Ten Commandments but also Christ’s own actions, His sacrificial death, or experiencing God’s kindness. Luther insists that simply excluding the Ten Commandments from Christian teaching does not abolish the law’s power to accuse. To argue that Christians need never hear the law again is to imply that believers have ceased to be sinners, and that the church is comprised solely of perfectly sanctified people—which is not the case.\n\n**4.**  \nIn addressing antinomian positions, Luther reiterates the \"second use of the law,\" explaining it as the way the Holy Spirit employs the law to make individuals conscious of their sinful condition, thus readying them for the salvation Christ offers through the gospel. He says that anything that stirs sorrow for sin—whether it’s Jesus’ teachings, His death, or the goodness people encounter in the world—can be seen as the law in action. Simply omitting the teaching of the Ten Commandments from church life doesn’t make the accusing force of the law disappear. To assert that Christians no longer need the law preached to them is to mistakenly claim that believers are no longer sinful, and that the church is only made up of the already fully holy.",

According to Luther, anything that stirs sorrow for sin functions as the law, even if it involves Christ’s actions or the recognition of God’s goodness in creation. Doing away with the formal teaching of the Ten Commandments does not nullify the law’s accusing function.

Simply avoiding preaching the Ten Commandments in the church—essentially removing the word \"law\"—does not get rid of its accusatory function. To say that the law shouldn’t be preached to Christians at all would be to imply that Christians no longer sin and that the church is only made up of truly holy people.\n\n2.\nMartin Luther, in his writings against antinomians, restates the doctrine known as the \"second use of the law,\" which says the law is a tool used by the Holy Spirit to make people aware of their sinfulness and in need of Christ. He argues that anything leading to sorrow over sin, whether it’s the story of Christ, His crucifixion, or even witnessing God's kindness in the world, qualifies as “law.” Merely deciding not to preach the Ten Commandments does not erase the law’s power to accuse. Suggesting that the law should never be preached to Christians is effectively saying Christians no longer sin and the church is entirely made up of holy individuals.\n\n3.\nLuther, in his debates with antinomians, maintains the importance of the \"second use of the law,\" meaning the law brings about a sense of guilt over sin, guiding people toward Christ’s redemptive work in the gospel. He explains that anything that produces awareness or regret for sin—whether it’s Christ’s actions, his death, or the general experience of God’s goodness—can be seen as the law at work. Not teaching the Ten Commandments doesn't actually remove the reality of the law from the church. To argue that Christians don’t need to hear the law is to claim they are already without sin and that the church is made up only of perfectly holy people.\n\n4.\nIn addressing the antinomians, Luther confirms what’s sometimes called the “second use of the law”—namely, that the law is used by the Holy Spirit to make people conscious of their sins, thus leading them to Christ and his fulfillment of the law. Anything that causes sorrow over sin falls under the category of the law for Luther—even the message of Christ’s life and death or the experience of God’s kindness. Refusing to preach the Ten Commandments in church won’t actually get rid of the law’s accusing role. Saying that the law should never be preached to Christians amounts to claiming that Christians aren’t sinners anymore and that the church is only full of holy people."

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a few different ways, each one separated by a newline.\n\nPassage:\nMartin Luther\nIn his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Luther reviews and reaffirms, on the one hand, what has been called the \"second use of the law,\" that is, the law as the Holy Spirit's tool to work sorrow over sin in man's heart, thus preparing him for Christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel. Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law. Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine are involved in both democratic politics and armed resistance, with the goal of eliminating Israel. In contrast, extremist groups such as al-Qaeda, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and the Taliban reject democracy outright, labeling pro-democracy Muslims as unbelievers (a doctrine known as takfirism) and promoting violent jihad or attacks justified by religion.\n\n2.  \nIslamist groups vary in their acceptance of democracy. The Ennahda Movement in Tunisia represents moderate and reformist Islamists who participate in democratic politics. Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan is a largely democratic and socio-political group, although it has pursued power through military coups before. Organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas are notable for their dual roles in democratic processes and armed conflict, aiming for the destruction of Israel. By contrast, radical Islamist groups like al-Qaeda, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and the Taliban reject democracy altogether, often accusing pro-democracy Muslims of apostasy (takfir) and advocating or perpetrating violence under religious pretexts.\n\n3.  \nWithin Islamism, there are movements like Tunisia's Ennahda that embrace democracy and reform. Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan is structured as a democratic vanguard party but has historically gained influence via military intervention as well. Islamist organizations like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine participate in both political and militant activities, striving to end the existence of Israel. On the other hand, radical groups such as al-Qaeda, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and the Taliban reject democracy completely, sometimes declaring Muslims who support it to be nonbelievers (takfirism), and calling for or carrying out religiously motivated violence.\n\n4.  \nThere are different strands of Islamism: some, like the Tunisian Ennahda Movement, are moderate and choose to work through democratic means. Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan combines a socio-political mission with democratic engagement, though it has also used military coups to gain power. Groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas take part in both the political process and armed struggle, primarily aiming to dismantle Israel. Conversely, radical groups like al-Qaeda, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and the Taliban refuse to accept democracy, often condemning pro-democracy Muslims as infidels (through takfirism), and encouraging or enacting violence based on religious grounds."

      "1.  \nDuring the Yuan dynasty, extensive public works were carried out. Notably, Kublai Khan employed master astronomer Guo Shoujing, who oversaw various engineering projects and played a key role in updating the lunisolar calendar, making it highly accurate—differing by only 26 seconds from today’s Gregorian system. Transportation networks like roads and waterways were overhauled, and granaries were set up across the empire as a safeguard against famine. Beijing was redesigned with grand palaces, artificial landscapes, and parks, while it also became the endpoint of the newly refurbished Grand Canal. These enhancements spurred both land and sea trade, improved ties with Europe, and allowed Chinese experts to share knowledge abroad, such as hydraulic technology. In return, China received important crops like sorghum and new culinary techniques from foreign lands.\n\n2.  \nThe Yuan dynasty invested heavily in public infrastructure. Leading these efforts was the renowned astronomer Guo Shoujing, who not only managed many engineering projects but also refined the Yuan calendar to achieve a precision nearly matching the modern Gregorian calendar. The government improved and reorganized roads and waterways, and granaries were established to prevent food shortages.

One mechanism is user-adjustable, while the other is built as a last-resort safeguard. Traditionally, safety valves consisted of a simple lever holding down a plug valve on top of the boiler, with a weight or spring on one end to keep the valve closed against the steam. Early on, drivers could adjust these valves themselves, but this sometimes led to accidents when operators tightened the valve to increase steam pressure for more engine power. Modern safety valves, however, use a spring-loaded design that locks in place and can't be adjusted without breaking a seal, making them significantly safer.[citation needed]\n\n**2.**  \nTo prevent boiler overpressure, steam engines are commonly equipped with two independent safety systems: one that users can adjust and another that acts as a backup in case the first fails. In the past, a straightforward lever mechanism held a plug valve shut at the boiler's top, using a weight or spring for resistance. Because early versions could easily be modified by drivers, there were incidents where increased steam pressure caused accidents. Nowadays, a more secure, adjustable spring-based safety valve is used, designed such that tampering requires breaking an illegal seal, which greatly improves safety.[citation needed]\n\n**3.**  \nMost steam engines incorporate two distinct mechanisms to keep boiler pressure from rising too much; one is intended for adjustment by the operator, while the other serves as a final safety measure. Traditionally, a simple lever system with a weight or spring was used to hold a plug valve closed. This setup, however, allowed engine drivers to increase the steam pressure by fastening the valve more tightly, occasionally leading to hazardous situations. The latest safety valves employ a lockable, spring-loaded mechanism that cannot be changed without breaking a seal, providing a much safer solution.[citation needed]\n\n**4.**  \nSteam engines often feature a pair of independent safeguards to stop boiler pressure from exceeding safe limits. The user can adjust the first, while the second is a fixed, ultimate safety device. Older steam engine safety valves relied on a lever and weight (or spring) to hold down a plug valve on top of the boiler. Because earlier designs could be altered by drivers seeking more power, this sometimes led to dangerous accidents. The modern spring-loaded safety valve is both adjustable and sealed so that tampering requires breaking a seal—this has greatly enhanced safety.[citation needed]",

This work was important for the advancement of German language and literary forms.

      "1.  \nDuring a period when there was a growing appetite for books in German, the Bible translated by Martin Luther rapidly gained popularity and became highly influential. Luther’s translation significantly shaped the development of German language and literature. Accompanied by his notes and introductions, and featuring woodcut illustrations by Lucas Cranach that included anti-papal themes, this edition was instrumental in spreading Luther’s teachings across Germany. Furthermore, the Luther Bible affected subsequent translations, inspiring versions such as William Tyndale’s English Bible, which eventually led to the King James Bible.\n\n2.  \nMartin Luther’s Bible appeared as interest in German-language works soared, and it soon gained wide popularity and impact. This translation greatly contributed to the growth of the German language and culture. Luther added his own commentary and prefatory material, while Lucas Cranach’s woodcuts, some of which depicted anti-papal scenes, helped communicate his ideas. The Luther Bible not only advanced the Reformation in Germany but also influenced later vernacular Bibles, such as Tyndale’s English translation, paving the way for the King James Version.\n\n3.  \nAt a time when more people wanted to read printed works in German, Martin Luther’s Bible translation became a bestseller and a foundational text. By providing his own explanatory notes and incorporating Lucas Cranach’s illustrations, which sometimes contained criticism of the papacy, Luther’s Bible aided both religious reform and the standardization of the German language. This influential translation served as a model for other Bible translators, including William Tyndale, whose work was a forerunner of the King James Bible.\n\n4.  \nMartin Luther’s translation of the Bible appeared just as demand for German books was increasing, and it quickly achieved widespread circulation and influence. His version played a vital role in shaping both German language and literature. With prefaces and annotations by Luther himself, and striking anti-papal images by artist Lucas Cranach, the Luther Bible was pivotal in disseminating Reformation ideas throughout Germany. It also had a lasting impact on subsequent Bible translations in other languages, notably inspiring Tyndale’s early English Bible, a source for the King James Bible.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more versions or for any to be made more concise or detailed!"

      "1.  \nDuring the 1960s, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) sought to distinguish itself from other networks by embracing family-friendly series and gradually switching to color broadcasts. On September 30, 1960, ABC debuted *The Flintstones*, an animated show created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Even though the series was produced in color, it originally aired in black-and-white because ABC hadn't yet upgraded its equipment to support color broadcasts. *The Flintstones* marked a new era by introducing animated programming to prime-time television and helped ABC replace the family programming void left after its partnership with Disney ended.\n\n2.  \nThe 1960s were a transformative period for ABC, as the network focused on airing more family-oriented shows to compete with other broadcasters, while also moving toward showcasing color television. A notable example of this was the premiere of *The Flintstones* on September 30, 1960. Although the show was created in color by Hanna and Barbera, ABC initially aired it in black-and-white, due to the lack of technical equipment for color broadcasting. This strategy not only introduced prime-time animated content but also helped ABC compensate for the loss of Disney-produced family programming.\n\n3.  \nABC's strategy in the 1960s centered on countering its rivals with family-based series and slowly transitioning its broadcasts from black-and-white to color. When *The Flintstones* launched on September 30, 1960, it became one of the earliest animated series intended for prime-time audiences. Despite being produced in color, viewers first saw it in black-and-white, since ABC's infrastructure wasn't yet ready for color TV. Bringing *The Flintstones* to its lineup helped ABC appeal to families and fill a gap left by the end of its association with Disney.\n\n4.  \nIn the 1960s, ABC aimed to outdo established networks by featuring more shows suited for families and adopting color technology. A milestone was reached with the debut of *The Flintstones* on September 30, 1960, created by Hanna and Barbera. Originally filmed in color, the show aired in black-and-white because ABC had not yet updated its broadcast facilities. *The Flintstones* provided ABC with unique, animated content during prime time and helped the network transition away from its former Disney family programming.",
      "1.  \nDuring the 1960s, ABC sought to distinguish itself from other networks by introducing more family-focused shows, while also gradually shifting its broadcasts to color. The Flintstones, created by Hanna and Barbera, debuted on September 30, 1960, serving as another strategy of counterprogramming. Although the show was filmed in color from the outset, ABC initially aired it in black-and-white due to a lack of color broadcasting technology. This prime-time animated series not only brought novelty to ABC’s lineup but also helped the network replace family programming lost with the end of its Disney partnership.\n\n2.  \nIn response to established rivals, ABC ramped up its production of family-friendly series throughout the 1960s and slowly transitioned to color broadcasting. On September 30, 1960, the network launched The Flintstones, a show from Hanna and Barbera, as part of its counterprogramming efforts. Even though the series was produced in color, it first aired in black-and-white because ABC hadn’t upgraded its color technology yet. The Flintstones provided ABC with an innovative prime-time cartoon and helped fill the void left when Disney programming ended.\n\n3.  \nThroughout the 1960s, ABC’s strategy included adding more family-oriented series and making a slow move toward color television. One significant example was the premiere of The Flintstones on September 30, 1960. Produced by Hanna and Barbera, this animated show was ABC’s answer to its competitors and, although shot in color, initially played in black-and-white since the network lacked the color broadcasting capabilities. The Flintstones brought a new concept to primetime and allowed ABC to supplement its schedule with family shows after losing access to Disney content.\n\n4.  \nABC’s approach in the 1960s included increasing family-oriented programming and gradually converting to color broadcasts.

      "1.  \nThroughout the 1960s, ABC focused on developing family-friendly series as a way to stand out from competing networks. This period also saw ABC slowly moving toward color broadcasts. For example, on September 30, 1960, ABC debuted The Flintstones, an animated show produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Although created in color, the show initially aired in black-and-white because ABC hadn’t yet updated its equipment for color transmission. The Flintstones introduced the unique concept of a prime-time cartoon to viewers and partly replaced the family programming space left after ABC’s partnership with Disney ended.\n\n2.  \nDuring the 1960s, the American Broadcasting Company worked to attract audiences by launching family-oriented shows, a strategy aimed at competing with more established networks. At the same time, ABC began shifting its broadcasts toward color, though this was a gradual process. The Flintstones, which premiered on September 30, 1960, exemplified this shift. Produced by Hanna and Barbera, it was the first prime-time animated series filmed in color, but ABC could only air it in black-and-white due to technical constraints. The show not only brought something new to prime time but also helped ABC recover from the loss of its collaboration with Disney by sourcing family content from other creators.\n\n3.  \nIn the 1960s, ABC responded to its rivals by introducing more family-centered programs, while slowly updating its broadcasts to color. When The Flintstones premiered on September 30, 1960, it presented a prime-time animated series option—a major innovation at the time. Although the show was produced in color, ABC was initially only able to show it in black-and-white because the network hadn't fully transitioned to color technology. The Flintstones allowed ABC to fill the void left by the end of its Disney partnership, as it began airing family offerings from different producers.\n\n4.  \nThe 1960s era of the American Broadcasting Company was characterized by a growing lineup of family-focused television as the network sought to differentiate itself from established competitors. ABC was also slowly adopting color broadcasting during this time. A notable example of these changes was the launch of The Flintstones on September 30, 1960. Despite being animated in color, the series aired in black-and-white at first because ABC hadn’t updated its systems yet. This innovative show brought prime-time animation to viewers and helped ABC replace the family programming previously provided by Disney with content from other producers.",

Here are multiple rewritten versions of the passage, each separated by a newline as you requested:\n\n1.  \nDuring the 1960s, ABC sought to challenge its established rivals by introducing more family-friendly series. This period also saw the network steadily shifting toward color broadcasts. On September 30, 1960, ABC debuted The Flintstones, a prime illustration of counterprogramming. Even though the show, created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, was produced in color, it first aired in black-and-white because ABC hadn't yet upgraded its equipment for color transmission. The Flintstones helped ABC offer the unique appeal of animated programming in prime time and enabled the network to fill the gap left when its Disney collaboration ended by airing other family-focused shows.\n\n2.  \nThe American Broadcasting Company, throughout the 1960s, responded to competition by introducing more family-centric programs. At the same time, the network was slowly adopting color broadcasting. Premiering The Flintstones on September 30, 1960, ABC presented both counterprogramming and innovation; while the series by Hanna and Barbera was created in color, initial episodes aired in black-and-white since the network’s color broadcast capabilities were not yet in place. This move helped ABC experiment with prime-time animation and compensate for the loss of Disney content by sourcing family shows from different producers.\n\n3.  \nIn the 1960s, ABC countered its competitors by increasingly focusing on family-oriented shows and by incrementally moving toward color television. The debut of The Flintstones on September 30, 1960, exemplified this approach to counterprogramming. Although Hanna-Barbera produced the animated series in color, it was initially broadcast in black-and-white due to ABC's lack of color transmission technology. Bringing The Flintstones to prime-time let ABC offer viewers something new—animated programming—while also helping to fill the absence created by ending its partnership with Disney, through acquiring other family-friendly content.\n\n4.  \nABC’s strategy in the 1960s included ramping up family-themed programming to compete with more entrenched networks, along with a slow progression to color broadcasts. On September 30, 1960, ABC launched The Flintstones, an innovative animated show by Hanna and Barbera. Despite being made in color, early episodes aired in black-and-white because ABC hadn’t yet adapted its broadcast capabilities. The Flintstones allowed the network to feature prime-time animation and helped fill the void left by the end of its relationship with Disney, adding more family programming from new sources.",

It is God's work in our lives, helping us move away from our sinful nature toward the loving desires of God. Through prevenient grace, God wants us to realize both our own sinfulness and His offer of salvation. This grace gives all people, despite their sin, the freedom to either accept or reject salvation in Christ.\n\nUnited Methodist Church  \nPrevenient grace refers to the grace that precedes our own efforts, given by God to all human beings. It is the force that awakens our ability to love and inspires us to seek connection with God through Jesus Christ. In this act, God works to steer us away from our naturally sinful inclinations toward His loving purpose. God's intention is for us to recognize our own brokenness and also His gift of salvation. Prevenient grace means that even those affected by sin still have the real freedom to accept or decline God’s salvation in Christ.\n\nUnited Methodist Church  \nPrevenient grace, meaning the grace that comes before anything we do, is granted by God to everyone. It enables us to love and nudges us to look for a relationship with God through Christ. This grace is God acting now to turn us from our sinful tendencies to what God desires for us in love. In this, God wants us to understand both how deeply we need Him and the reality of His salvation. Prevenient grace lets those who are flawed by sin make a genuinely free decision about whether to receive or refuse the salvation God offers in Jesus."

In contrast, in less developed countries, malnutrition is the leading reason for immunodeficiency. Diets low in protein can hinder various immune functions, such as cell-mediated responses, complement pathway, phagocyte action, IgA antibody levels, and cytokine production.

Early removal or loss of the thymus gland, whether from genetic causes or surgery, can also lead to profound immune weakness and increased infection risk.\n\n4.  \nImmunodeficiencies develop when components of the immune system are missing or not active. The immune system’s effectiveness drops in both younger individuals and the elderly, particularly starting in the 50s, due to the aging process called immunosenescence. In richer countries, poor immune health is often linked to obesity, alcohol misuse, or drug intake, whereas in poorer regions, malnutrition is the primary culprit. Lack of protein in nutrition disrupts many immune processes such as cellular immunity, complement activity, phagocyte performance, the production of IgA antibodies, and cytokines.

      "1. Newborn babies, having no previous exposure to germs, are highly susceptible to infections. The mother provides several forms of passive immunity. One way is through the transfer of IgG antibodies across the placenta during pregnancy, giving the baby a supply of antibodies at birth that mirrors those of the mother. Additionally, antibodies in breast milk or colostrum protect the infant’s gut from bacterial infections until the baby’s own immune system matures. This form of protection is considered passive because the baby does not produce the antibodies or immune memory itself—it simply receives them. Passive immunity is temporary, usually lasting from a few days to a few months. Doctors can also provide passive immunity by giving antibody-rich serum to patients.\n\n2. Infants, who haven’t yet encountered many germs, are especially prone to infections. However, mothers supply layers of passive defense. During pregnancy, IgG antibodies are passed from mother to child via the placenta, so babies are born with a supply of antibodies similar to their mother’s. Breast milk and colostrum also pass antibodies to the baby's digestive system, guarding against harmful bacteria until the child's immune system is ready to take over. Since these antibodies aren’t produced by the child, but rather borrowed, this is called passive immunity, which only lasts for a limited time—from days to months. In healthcare, passive immunity can also be induced by transferring antibody-rich serum from one person to another.\n\n3. Because newborns have not yet been exposed to microorganisms, they are very vulnerable to infections. Mothers help protect their babies by providing passive immunity in several ways. IgG antibodies cross the placenta to the fetus during pregnancy, ensuring that babies are born with high antibody levels matching the mother’s. Additionally, breast milk and colostrum deliver antibodies to the baby's gut, helping prevent bacterial infections until the baby starts making its own antibodies. This type of immunity is called passive since the infant doesn’t create these antibodies or immune cells itself; it only receives them from the mother. Typically, passive immunity is short-lived, lasting only a few days to months. Clinically, passive immunity can also be delivered artificially through antibody-rich serum injections.\n\n4. Since babies haven’t encountered pathogens before birth, they are at greater risk from infections. Mothers provide passive immune protection during pregnancy as IgG antibodies pass through the placenta, equipping infants with the same antibody range as their mothers. The first milk, known as colostrum, and ongoing breast milk also give the baby extra antibodies to protect against bacteria in the digestive tract until the baby can make its own immune responses. This borrowed protection is termed passive immunity, which doesn’t last long—just a few days or months. Additionally, passive immunity can be administered medically by transferring serum containing antibodies between individuals.",
      "1.  \nNewborn babies, having never encountered microbes before, are especially at risk for infections. To help protect them, mothers provide several layers of passive immunity. While in the womb, a specific antibody known as IgG passes from mother to child through the placenta, giving babies a high level of antibodies at birth—mirroring their mother’s immune profile. Additionally, breast milk or colostrum delivers further antibodies directly to the infant’s gut, helping guard against bacterial infections until the baby can produce its own antibodies. This protection is called passive immunity, since the infant isn’t creating its own antibodies or memory cells but is temporarily using those from the mother. Such immunity only lasts a short time—ranging from a few days to a few months. In clinical settings, passive immunity can also be given artificially by transferring antibody-rich serum from one person to another.\n\n2.  \nBecause newborns have not yet encountered germs, they are especially susceptible to infections. Mothers help shield their babies with passive defenses: IgG antibodies pass through the placenta during pregnancy, so babies are born with a supply of their mother’s antibodies, capable of targeting the same antigens. Further protection comes from antibodies in breast milk or colostrum, which coat the baby’s gut and fend off bacteria until the baby is capable of making its own antibodies. This form of immunity is passive, as the infant is simply using borrowed antibodies, not producing them. Passive immunity is temporary, persisting from several days to months. In medical practice, doctors can also induce passive immunity by giving a person antibody-rich serum from someone else.\n\n3.  \nAt birth, infants lack prior microbial exposure and are more vulnerable to infections. However, mothers offer several mechanisms of passive immunity: IgG antibodies are transferred from mother to fetus via the placenta, so newborns start life with a robust supply of maternal antibodies. Likewise, breast milk and colostrum contain additional antibodies that help protect the baby’s gut against bacteria. This type of immunity is called passive since the antibodies are obtained from outside rather than produced by the infant, and it doesn’t involve creating memory cells. The effect is short-lived, lasting anywhere from a few days up to several months. Similarly, passive immunity can be administered medically by injecting antibody-rich serum from another individual.\n\n4.  \nBecause their immune systems are immature and unexposed to pathogens, newborns are highly prone to infections. To counter this, mothers provide passive immune support: During pregnancy, IgG antibodies cross the placenta from mother to fetus, giving the newborn antibody levels similar to its mother’s. After birth, breastfeeding supplies extra antibodies that help guard the digestive system from harmful bacteria until the infant’s own immune system matures. This is considered passive immunity, since the antibodies are donated rather than made by the baby, and no immune memory is formed. Passive immunity tends to be short-term, often lasting only a few days to a few months. In addition, doctors can confer passive immunity with injectable antibody-rich serum.",

      "1.  \nIn Kenya, diseases related to poverty are tightly linked to the nation’s economic conditions and the unequal distribution of wealth: about half of the population lives in poverty. The main health challenges, especially affecting children, are preventable diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition. These are made worse by poor governance, corruption, a shortage of healthcare workers, inefficient management, and inadequate leadership in public health. As of 2009, around 6.3% of adults were living with HIV. Still, the 2011 UNAIDS Report offers hope, indicating that HIV rates are decreasing among young people and pregnant women. In 2006, malaria affected an estimated 15 million Kenyans.\n\n2.  \nAbout 50% of Kenyans live below the poverty line, and this poverty is closely associated with the country’s burden of disease. Major childhood killers include diseases that could be prevented, like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition. A range of systemic failures—such as weak policies, corruption, insufficient numbers of health workers, and poor leadership—exacerbate these health problems. The HIV rate among adults was estimated at 6.3% in 2009, but the 2011 UNAIDS Report pointed to an improvement, noting declines in HIV among young adults and pregnant women.

Preventable illnesses, including malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and malnutrition, are the leading causes of death and illness, especially among children. Major contributing factors include weak public health policies, corruption, not enough healthcare workers, poor management, and ineffective leadership. By 2009, HIV was prevalent in 6.3% of adults; however, the 2011 UNAIDS Report noted decreasing HIV rates among those aged 15–24 and pregnant women. In 2006, malaria cases numbered about 15 million.\n\n4.  \nKenya’s health challenges are heavily influenced by widespread poverty: half of its population lives in impoverished conditions. Easily preventable diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition are the biggest threats, particularly for children. The persistence of these diseases is largely due to ineffective government policies, corruption, a lack of health professionals, and poor leadership within the public health sector. As per estimates from 2009, 6.3% of Kenyan adults were HIV positive. Encouragingly, the 2011 UNAIDS Report found that HIV rates are dropping among young people and pregnant women.

In 2009, around 6.3% of Kenyan adults were HIV-positive, though recent reports indicate the situation may be improving, especially among young people and pregnant women. In 2006, malaria affected an estimated 15 million Kenyans.\n\n3.  \nThe prevalence of poverty-related illnesses in Kenya is directly tied to the nation's economy and how wealth is distributed, with half the country living beneath the poverty threshold. The biggest health burdens—malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition—are largely preventable but remain the principal causes of illness and child death due to failures in leadership, policy, and staffing within the health sector. HIV affected 6.3% of adults in 2009, yet the 2011 UNAIDS Report points to encouraging trends, such as reduced HIV rates among the youth and pregnant women. There were approximately 15 million malaria cases reported in 2006.\n\n4.  \nPoverty and disease are closely connected in Kenya, where about 50% of people live below the poverty line. Preventable diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition create a heavy health burden, especially for children. Public health problems are made worse by corruption, weak management, poor policies, and not enough skilled health workers. HIV prevalence among adults was around 6.3% in 2009, but newer data from 2011 indicates that rates are falling in younger people and pregnant women. The country experienced an estimated 15 million malaria cases in 2006.",
      "Sure! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage:\n\nKenya  \nThere is a strong link between diseases associated with poverty and a nation’s economic status and wealth distribution. In Kenya, half of the population lives below the poverty line. Diseases that could be prevented—such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition—are the leading causes of illness and child mortality. This heavy disease burden is worsened by weak policies, corruption, insufficient health personnel, poor management, and inadequate leadership in the country's public health sector. As of 2009, around 6.3% of Kenyan adults were living with HIV, though a 2011 UNAIDS report indicates that the HIV situation may be improving, particularly among youths aged 15–24 and pregnant women. In 2006, there were about 15 million malaria cases reported in Kenya.\n\nKenya  \nPoverty and disease are closely connected in Kenya, where about half the population subsists below the poverty threshold. Preventable illnesses such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition are the main health challenges, especially for children, resulting in high rates of sickness and death. The root causes include ineffective health sector policies, a shortage of health workers, mismanagement, and corruption. HIV affected roughly 6.3% of adults in 2009, but newer data from UNAIDS in 2011 show progress, with falling rates among young adults and pregnant women. In 2006, Kenya recorded approximately 15 million malaria cases.\n\nKenya  \nThe incidence of poverty-related diseases in Kenya is closely tied to the nation's levels of wealth and how it's shared. Half of Kenyans live in poverty, and preventable diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition are prevalent, causing high child mortality and widespread illness. Failings in policy, insufficient health professionals, corruption, weak management, and lackluster leadership contribute significantly to these issues. HIV prevalence among Kenyans aged 15 and older was estimated at 6.3% in 2009, but according to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, there are signs of improvement, especially among teens and expectant mothers. As of 2006, 15 million malaria cases were estimated nationwide.\n\nKenya  \nThere is a significant correlation between a country's economy and the occurrence of illnesses associated with poverty. In Kenya, where half of the people are below the poverty line, preventable diseases—malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition—pose the greatest health threats, especially to children, with many falling ill or dying each year. Issues such as poor governance, corruption, lack of qualified health staff, and mismanagement of the health system exacerbate the situation. HIV affected approximately 6.3% of adults in 2009, though statistics from UNAIDS in 2011 suggest a drop in new cases among young people and pregnant women. In 2006, Kenya faced around 15 million cases of malaria."

      "1.  \nAccording to Robert J. Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013, the rising gap between the rich and poor in the United States and other places is the biggest challenge today. Growing inequality slows down economic progress. When unemployment is high and lasts a long time, inequality tends to go up, which further hurts economic growth in the long run. Unemployment doesn’t just waste human resources; it also sets off pressures to redistribute wealth, causes economic distortions, forces people into poverty, limits their ability to move for work, and damages self-worth, all of which can lead to social problems and unrest. Therefore, policies that address unemployment and its effects on inequality help promote steady economic growth.\n\n2.  \n2013 Nobel laureate in Economics, Robert J. Shiller, emphasized that increasing inequality is the main issue facing the U.S. and the world. A rise in inequality negatively impacts economic development. Prolonged and widespread unemployment, which typically leads to greater inequality, reduces future economic growth. The adverse effects of unemployment extend beyond wasted potential; it also causes pressure for wealth redistribution and creates economic inefficiencies. Additionally, it pushes individuals into poverty, hinders their ability to move between jobs, and damages their confidence, resulting in social instability and potential conflict. Implementing policies to reduce unemployment and address the negative impacts of inequality can help foster economic growth.\n\n3.  \nNobel Prize-winning economist Robert J. Shiller stated that growing inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere is today’s most serious problem. Rising inequality slows down economic advancement. When unemployment is high and long-lasting, it tends to worsen inequality, which in turn negatively influences long-term economic expansion. Unemployment’s damages go beyond wasted labor—it provokes demands for redistribution and distorts the economy, traps individuals in poverty, restricts their job options, and reduces self-confidence, all of which can lead to social unrest and conflict. Policies aimed at lowering unemployment and especially its inequality-related effects help support the economy’s growth.\n\n4.  \nRobert J. Shiller, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013, argued that the surge in inequality in America and abroad is the most crucial issue we face. Increased inequality stifles economic growth. Persistently high unemployment that causes inequality to rise can weaken long-term economic progress. The negative impact of unemployment isn’t just lost productivity; it also sparks redistribution demands and market distortions, drives poverty, restricts labor flexibility, and harms self-esteem, which can encourage social unrest and conflict. As a result, policies focused on reducing unemployment and its related inequality effects bolster economic growth.",
      "**1.**  \nRobert J. Shiller, recipient of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics, identified rising economic inequality in the United States and other countries as the most pressing issue. He argues that growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth. Persistent and high unemployment, which typically increases inequality, adversely impacts long-term economic expansion. This is because unemployment represents wasted resources, creates pressures for redistribution that alter incentives, pushes people into poverty, restricts access to funds and limits job mobility, and damages self-worth, which can cause social unrest and conflict. Therefore, policies that target unemployment and its inequality-related effects can help foster economic growth.\n\n**2.**  \n2013 Nobel laureate Robert J. Shiller describes growing inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere as the most significant challenge today. Rising inequality slows economic progress. When unemployment is high and persists, inequality rises, which in turn hampers sustained economic growth. Unemployment is harmful not only due to resource wastage but also because it causes redistributive demands and market disruptions, increases poverty, limits access to credit and job opportunities, and damages individual self-esteem—ultimately leading to social instability and conflict. Strategies that address unemployment, particularly those that reduce the inequality it causes, are beneficial for economic development.\n\n**3.**  \nAccording to Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert J. Shiller, increasing economic inequality is the most critical issue globally. Inequality that rises over time can slow down economic advancement. Long-term, widespread unemployment—where inequality worsens—negatively influences future economic growth by wasting resources, encouraging redistribution and distortion, deepening poverty, restricting liquidity and labor movement, and undermining people's confidence, which can fuel social problems and unrest. Thus, targeted policies to lower unemployment and lessen the negative effects related to inequality are essential for supporting economic growth.\n\n**4.**  \nRobert J. Shiller, a Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has emphasized that the greatest problem facing countries such as the United States is the rise in economic inequality. Inequality’s rise is damaging to economic growth. Persistent unemployment, which often leads to greater inequality, has significant negative consequences for long-term economic expansion. Not only does it waste resources, but unemployment also gives rise to demands for redistribution, heightens poverty, restricts liquidity and job changes, and undermines self-worth, resulting in societal instability and conflict. Therefore, measures to manage unemployment and its impacts on inequality are key to promoting sustained economic growth.",
      "1.  \nRobert J. Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013, highlighted that rising economic inequality in the United States and around the world is a crucial issue. Growing inequality negatively impacts economic growth. Persistent high unemployment, which is closely tied to inequality, further weakens long-term economic prosperity. Unemployment not only wastes valuable resources, but also causes redistributive struggles, pushes more people into poverty, limits people’s ability to move for work, and damages self-confidence, leading to social problems and unrest. Therefore, policies that specifically address unemployment and its link to inequality are important for encouraging economic growth.\n\n2.  \nAccording to Robert J. Shiller, the recipient of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics, the most pressing issue facing the US and other countries is increasing economic inequality. He notes that this trend negatively affects economic expansion. High and sustained unemployment, associated with growing inequality, is particularly harmful to long-term growth. This is due to both the direct waste of resources and the indirect consequences: increased demands for redistribution, greater poverty, reduced mobility, and lower self-esteem, all contributing to social instability. Effective policies to lower unemployment and its unequal impact can help foster economic progress.\n\n3.  \n2013 Nobel laureate Robert J. Shiller identifies rising inequality, especially in the US, as the most significant challenge. He asserts that greater inequality undermines economic growth, and that long-term, high unemployment—which usually comes with increased inequality—further damages future growth prospects. Unemployment is harmful both because of lost productivity and because it leads to demands for redistribution, entrenched poverty, reduced workplace mobility, and loss of self-worth, which together spark social discord and conflict. Addressing unemployment and its unequal effects is therefore essential for supporting sustained economic development.",

Growing inequality slows economic progress. Long-lasting high unemployment rates, which worsen inequality, negatively impact economic growth over the long term. Unemployment is damaging not only because it represents underused resources, but also because it puts pressure on redistribution, distorts economies, pushes more people into poverty, hinders financial flexibility and labor movement, and damages self-worth, leading to social strife and disorder. Strategies to address unemployment, especially those that also target inequality, help sustain economic growth.\n\n**2.**  \nNobel laureate Robert J. Shiller has identified growing inequality, particularly in the United States, as a key concern. He argues that increasing inequality reduces economic growth, and that enduring high unemployment—when tied to greater inequality—has lasting negative effects on economic progress. Unemployment is problematic not just due to wasted potential, but because it intensifies redistributive demands, creates economic imbalances, increases poverty, restricts financial options and labor flexibility, and undermines confidence, which can breed social disturbance and conflict. Therefore, policies designed to reduce unemployment and its unequal consequences are essential for fostering economic growth.\n\n**3.**  \nRising economic inequality is regarded by 2013 Nobel Prize economist Robert J. Shiller as the most pressing problem, both in the US and globally. This inequality dampens economic growth.

The impact isn't merely resource wastage—unemployment also leads to increased demand for redistribution, market distortions, higher poverty levels, reduced mobility due to financial constraints, and loss of self-esteem, fostering social tension and unrest. Implementing policies that manage unemployment, especially by minimizing its inequality effects, is crucial for promoting growth.",
      "1.  \nAccording to Nobel laureate Robert J. Shiller, increasing inequality in the United States and globally is the most significant issue we face. Greater inequality limits economic growth, especially when accompanied by prolonged unemployment. Such unemployment not only wastes resources but also increases income disparity, stirs redistributive tensions, leads to greater poverty, reduces labor mobility due to limited liquidity, and damages self-esteem, causing social instability and conflict. Policies that address unemployment and its unequal effects can help foster stronger economic growth.\n\n2.  \n2013 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Robert J. Shiller, highlights that growing inequality, particularly in the U.S., is a major challenge. Economic growth suffers as inequality widens, especially in situations of high and prolonged unemployment. Unemployment doesn't just squander potential; it pressures redistribution, spurs systemic distortions, deepens poverty, restricts people’s ability to change jobs, and harms psychological well-being—contributing to social disruption. Addressing unemployment and its unequal impact is crucial for supporting long-term economic development.\n\n3.  \nRobert J. Shiller, who received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics, has identified rising inequality as the foremost problem both in America and around the world. He argues that economic growth is hindered by greater inequality, particularly during periods of sustained high unemployment. This unemployment damages growth through wasted resources and by worsening inequality. It puts stress on redistribution, exacerbates poverty, makes it harder for workers to move, and undermines people’s confidence, leading to unrest and conflict. Thus, policies that target unemployment, especially its unequal effects, can promote economic growth.\n\n4.  \nRising inequality is a central concern according to Nobel economist Robert J. Shiller, especially in the U.S. He notes that worsening inequality slows economic progress, with persistent unemployment playing a big role. Not only does unemployment squander resources, but it also intensifies inequality, creates pressure for redistribution, increases poverty, limits how easily people can move between jobs, and harms self-worth—all of which can lead to social upheaval.

The Mongol-appointed governor of Samarqand was a Qara-Khitay named Ahai, known for his familiarity with Chinese customs and holding the title Taishi.\n\n2.  \nThe Mongol rulers of the Yuan dynasty strategically used outsiders as administrators to weaken the control of native groups. They imported Central Asian Muslims to manage affairs in China and deployed Han Chinese and Khitans to supervise Muslims in Bukhara, Central Asia. Han Chinese populations were relocated to cities such as Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand, where they took up roles as artisans and farmers. The Mongols also incorporated Alans into their military; one particular unit, the \"Right Alan Guard,\" consisted of a mix of surrendered troops, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers, and was stationed in the former Kingdom of Qocho and Besh Balikh. There, a Chinese military colony was created under General Qi Kongzhi. After Genghis Khan conquered Central Asia, the Mongols assigned foreigners to administrative posts. They required Muslims in Samarqand to co-manage agricultural land with Chinese and Khitans, barring them from independent management. Samarqand’s governor was Ahai, a Qara-Khitay familiar with Chinese culture, who held the title Taishi.\n\n3.  \nUnder the Yuan dynasty, the Mongols practiced a policy of appointing foreigners to administrate their conquered territories. Central Asian Muslims were brought into China for administrative work, while Han Chinese and Khitans were dispatched to oversee Muslims in the Central Asian city of Bukhara. This exchange was meant to reduce local authority in both regions. Han Chinese groups were relocated by the Mongols to Central Asian places like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand to work as artisans and farmers. Alans were drafted into Mongol armies, including the \"Right Alan Guard,\" which included recent captives, Mongols, and Chinese, and was stationed in former Qocho and in Besh Balikh. A Chinese military colony was also established in Besh Balikh, commanded by Qi Kongzhi. After seizing Central Asia, Genghis Khan’s administration placed non-Muslim foreigners in governing roles, even requiring that Muslims in Samarqand jointly manage land with Chinese and Khitans, as they were forbidden from doing it alone. The head of Samarqand was Ahai, a culturally Chinese-aware Qara-Khitay holding the title Taishi.\n\n4.  \nWhen the Mongols ruled during the Yuan dynasty, they intentionally used administrators from foreign lands to disrupt the established power of local peoples. Central Asian Muslims were shipped to China to fill administrator roles, while Han Chinese and Khitans were sent in return to administrate over Muslims living in Bukhara, Central Asia. In addition, Han Chinese communities were relocated by the Mongols to serve as artisans and farmers in places such as Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand. The Mongol forces also recruited Alans, notably into a unit called the \"Right Alan Guard,\" which included surrendered troops, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers, and was stationed near the former Kingdom of Qocho and Besh Balikh, where a Chinese military colony was established under General Qi Kongzhi. After Genghis Khan conquered Central Asia, the new Mongol rulers selected foreigners as regional administrators and enforced rules in Samarqand that only allowed Muslims to manage gardens and fields if partnered with Chinese and Khitans.

      "1.  \nA number of theologians, such as Zwingli, Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Johannes Oecolampadius, held different views about the meaning of Jesus’ words at the Last Supper: “This is my body which is for you” and “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Martin Luther stood firm on his belief in the Real Presence, maintaining that Christ’s body and blood were truly present in the bread and wine, a concept he called sacramental union. His opponents argued that God was present only spiritually or symbolically. Zwingli, for instance, rejected the idea that Jesus could exist in more than one place at once, while Luther emphasized the omnipresence of Christ’s human nature. The debate between them often became heated. Quoting John 6:63, “The flesh profiteth nothing,” Zwingli declared, “This passage breaks your neck.” Luther responded, “Don’t be too proud. German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” Throughout, Luther wrote “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) in chalk to reinforce his unwavering position.\n\n2.  \nTheologians like Zwingli, Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Johannes Oecolampadius disagreed about what Jesus meant during the Last Supper when he said, “This is my body which is for you,” and, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Luther asserted that Christ’s body and blood were really present in the bread and wine, a view he termed sacramental union, while others thought God was present only symbolically or spiritually. Zwingli, for example, claimed that Jesus could not be in several places simultaneously, whereas Luther argued that Christ, in his human nature, was omnipresent. Their debate was sometimes contentious. Zwingli said, quoting John 6:63, “This passage breaks your neck,” to which Luther replied, “Don’t be too proud. German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” Luther kept “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) written on the table in chalk as a sign of his unyielding belief.\n\n3.  \nThere was disagreement among theologians such as Zwingli, Melanchthon, Bucer, and Oecolampadius about what Jesus meant at the Last Supper with his words, “This is my body which is for you” and “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Luther passionately defended the belief in the Real Presence, arguing that Christ was truly present in the consecrated bread and wine—a view he called sacramental union. His counterparts saw God as present only in a symbolic or spiritual sense. Zwingli, in particular, objected to the idea that Jesus could be physically present in more than one place at a time, but Luther insisted that Christ’s human nature had omnipresence. The discussions grew heated, with Zwingli once saying, “This passage breaks your neck,” quoting John 6:63. Luther retorted, “Don’t be too proud. German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” He showed his commitment by writing “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) in chalk on the table.",

Martin Luther maintained that Christ’s body and blood are truly present in the bread and wine through a “sacramental union,” opposing others who thought God’s presence was only symbolic or spiritual. Zwingli, for example, argued that Jesus couldn't be in multiple places at once, but Luther insisted that even Jesus’ human nature was omnipresent. The debates reportedly became heated. Zwingli cited John 6:63, “The flesh profiteth nothing,” and declared, “This passage breaks your neck.” Luther replied, “Don’t be too proud; German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” To signal his unwavering view, Luther wrote “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) in chalk on the table before him.\n\n2.  \nThe theologians Zwingli, Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Johannes Oecolampadius all had different interpretations of Jesus’ words at the Last Supper, found in 1 Corinthians 11:23–26. Luther argued that Christ was really present in the bread and wine, a belief he described as the sacramental union. His opponents, in contrast, saw Christ’s presence as purely symbolic or spiritual. Zwingli, specifically, said Jesus could not physically be in more than one location at a time, but Luther argued for the omnipresence of Christ’s human form as well. Sometimes the debates grew contentious. At one point, Zwingli brandished the phrase, “The flesh profiteth nothing,” from John 6:63, asserting, “This passage breaks your neck.” Luther countered, “German necks don’t break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” To emphasize his position, Luther chalked “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) on the table.\n\n3.  \nThere was significant disagreement among theologians such as Zwingli, Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Johannes Oecolampadius concerning what Jesus meant at the Last Supper when he said, “This is my body which is for you” and “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Martin Luther firmly believed in the actual presence of Christ’s body and blood in the eucharist, which he called the sacramental union. Others, however, argued that God was present only in a spiritual or symbolic sense. Zwingli, for one, denied that Jesus could be in several places simultaneously, while Luther championed the idea of Christ’s human omnipresence. The debate became quite heated, with Zwingli telling Luther, “This passage breaks your neck,” referencing John 6:63, to which Luther coolly responded that German necks don’t break so easily, insisting, “This is Hesse, not Switzerland.” Luther underlined his conviction by writing “Hoc est corpus meum” (“This is my body”) in chalk on the table.",

Martin Luther argued firmly for the Real Presence of Christ’s body and blood in the bread and wine, what he called the sacramental union. In contrast, his opponents claimed that God was present only symbolically or spiritually. Zwingli, specifically, believed Jesus could not physically exist in more than one place, but Luther emphasized the omnipresence of Jesus’ human nature. The debate grew heated at times; Zwingli quoted, “The flesh profiteth nothing” (John 6:63) and said it would ruin Luther’s argument. Luther replied, “Don’t be too proud.

Luther stood out by maintaining the belief in Christ’s actual, physical presence in the Eucharist, known as the sacramental union. His opponents, however, thought that Christ was present only in a spiritual or metaphorical sense. Zwingli argued Jesus could not be physically present in multiple places, but Luther held that Christ’s human nature was omnipresent. The discussions were intense; Zwingli asserted that Jesus’ words, “The flesh profiteth nothing,” undermined Luther’s view, to which Luther retorted that German necks wouldn’t break so easily and pointed out the debate was happening in Hesse, not Switzerland. Luther underscored his unwavering position by writing “Hoc est corpus meum” on the table.\n\n3.  \nMartin Luther, along with other theologians such as Zwingli, Melanchthon, Bucer, and Oecolampadius, clashed over how to interpret the words Jesus spoke during the Last Supper: “This is my body which is for you” and “This cup is the new covenant in my blood.” Luther believed firmly that Christ was truly present in the bread and wine (a concept he called the sacramental union), whereas his opponents maintained that Christ was present only symbolically or spiritually. Zwingli, for example, argued Jesus could not be in more than one place at once, but Luther countered by emphasizing Christ’s omnipresence. The debates could be quite confrontational. At one point Zwingli cited, “The flesh profiteth nothing,” arguing it refuted Luther’s stance, but Luther replied, “Don’t be too proud. German necks don’t break that easily.

His adversaries, however, saw the presence as symbolic or spiritual alone.

The first timeline covers all the time since the Earth formed, but this makes the most recent eon very small. To address this, the second timeline zooms in on the latest eon, though it compresses its latest era. The third timeline magnifies this most recent era. Because the Quaternary period is very short and consists of brief epochs, the fourth timeline provides a close-up of this period. Each of the second, third, and fourth timelines is a subset of the previous one, as shown by asterisks. The latest epoch, the Holocene, is too brief to display clearly on the third scale, which makes expanding the fourth scale helpful. The Pleistocene is indicated by “P,” and “Q” refers to the Quaternary period.\n\nGeologic time is represented across four increasingly detailed timelines. The first timeline covers all of Earth’s history but condenses recent events. Therefore, a second timeline expands the most recent eon, though it squeezes the latest era. The third timeline enlarges this era, and because the Quaternary period contains very short epochs, it is given its own, fourth, expanded timeline. Each subsequent timeline is a detailed section of the previous one, marked by asterisks. Since the Holocene epoch is so recent, it is not visible on the third timeline, which is why the fourth scale is needed. The abbreviation \"P\" stands for the Pleistocene epoch, while \"Q\" refers to the Quaternary period.\n\nTo illustrate geologic time, four different timelines are used. The first covers Earth’s entire history but compresses recent times. The second timeline zooms in on just the most recent eon, but ends up making the most recent era smaller. The third timeline expands this era, and finally, the fourth zooms in on the brief Quaternary period and its short epochs. Each new timeline is a part of the previous, as shown with asterisks. Because the Holocene epoch is so short, it’s not visible on the third timeline, making the fourth necessary. \"P\" represents the Pleistocene epoch and \"Q\" the Quaternary period.\n\nThe geologic timeline is divided into four successive scales. The first encompasses the full span from Earth’s origin to today, but this leaves the latest eon condensed. So, the second timeline shows just the latest eon at a larger scale, although this compresses its last era. The third timeline focuses on that compressed era, and the fourth zone highlights the rapidly changing epochs of the Quaternary, a very short time frame. Each subsequent timeline is a magnified segment of its predecessor, designated by asterisks. The Holocene, being the newest epoch, is too short to display well on the third timeline, necessitating the expanded fourth scale. \"P\" and \"Q\" stand for the Pleistocene epoch and the Quaternary period, respectively.",

Interestingly, only the chloroplast is retained, not the entire cryptophyte, as the organelle lacks its nucleomorph and has lost its two outermost membranes, resulting in a chloroplast with just two membranes. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts need their nucleomorph for maintenance, and Dinophysis species cannot survive long-term in lab cultures, it is suspected—though not proven—that these are kleptoplasts. This means Dinophysis possibly needs to keep capturing new cryptophytes to continually replace their worn-out chloroplasts.\n\n2.  \nThe genus Dinophysis is notable for harboring chloroplasts with phycobilins that originate from cryptophyte organisms. These chloroplasts are unique as Dinophysis does not retain the entire cryptophyte cell—only the chloroplast, which has been stripped of its nucleomorph and two outer membranes, so only a double-membraned organelle remains. Because cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to function properly, and Dinophysis cannot live indefinitely on their own in cultures, scientists think (though haven’t confirmed) that Dinophysis uses these as kleptoplasts, meaning they must periodically ingest new cryptophytes to replenish aging chloroplasts.\n\n3.  \nIn Dinophysis species, the chloroplasts they use are derived from cryptophytes and contain phycobilins, but only the chloroplast is taken—not the entire cryptophyte cell. These chloroplasts lack a nucleomorph and the outer two membranes, leaving a structure with just two membranes. Since a nucleomorph is necessary for the maintenance of cryptophyte chloroplasts, and Dinophysis cannot survive long in isolation, it suggests (but does not confirm) that these are kleptoplasts. As such, Dinophysis may need to regularly consume cryptophytes to replenish their functional chloroplasts as the old ones degrade.\n\n4.  \nMembers of the Dinophysis genus feature chloroplasts with phycobilins, which they obtain by absorbing chloroplasts from cryptophyte algae, not the whole organism. These stolen chloroplasts have lost their nucleomorph and two outermost membranes, leaving them with only two membranes. Given that cryptophyte chloroplasts cannot sustain themselves without a nucleomorph and Dinophysis cannot be grown indefinitely in culture, it is possible, though yet to be proven, that these chloroplasts are kleptoplasts and must be replaced repeatedly as they fail, requiring Dinophysis to continually consume cryptophytes.",
      "Certainly! Here are a few different rewrites of the given passage, each presented as a separate paragraph:\n\n---\n\nSome Dinophysis species possess a chloroplast with phycobilin pigments, which they acquire from cryptophytes. Interestingly, these species don't incorporate the entire cryptophyte as an endosymbiont—only the chloroplast is taken, and it lacks both the nucleomorph and the two outermost membranes, retaining just a chloroplast surrounded by two membranes. Normally, the nucleomorph is essential for cryptophyte chloroplast function, and when Dinophysis is cultured on its own, it cannot survive. This suggests—though it's not definitively proven—that the chloroplast may act as a kleptoplast, and that Dinophysis must repeatedly ingest cryptophytes to renew its supply of functional chloroplasts.\n\n---\n\nDinophysis genera acquire phycobilin-rich chloroplasts by extracting them from cryptophytes, but the process is unusual since only the chloroplast is taken—not the whole cryptophyte. As a result, the chloroplasts used by Dinophysis lack both their nucleomorph and outer protective membranes, existing only with two membranes. Because cryptophyte chloroplasts need their nucleomorph for upkeep, and Dinophysis can't survive for long in isolation, scientists think that these chloroplasts are likely kleptoplasts. If that's true, Dinophysis continually needs to ingest new cryptophytes to replenish worn-out chloroplasts.\n\n---\n\nThe genus Dinophysis is notable for possessing chloroplasts containing phycobilins, which are captured from cryptophyte algae. Uniquely, only the chloroplasts are retained, while the cryptophytes themselves are not kept as internal symbionts. Moreover, these borrowed chloroplasts have lost their nucleomorph and two outermost membranes, so they are left enveloped by only two membranes. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts depend on their nucleomorph for maintenance, and isolated Dinophysis are unable to grow, it is suspected—but not yet confirmed—that these are kleptoplasts, and Dinophysis must regularly ingest fresh cryptophytes to replace their declining chloroplasts.\n\n---\n\nIn Dinophysis, chloroplasts rich in phycobilins come from cryptophytes, but rather than keeping the whole cryptophyte as a symbiont, Dinophysis only takes the chloroplast. This chloroplast lacks the nucleomorph and the two external membranes, remaining surrounded by just two membranes. Because these chloroplasts in their original host require the nucleomorph for proper functioning, and Dinophysis can’t persist in pure culture, researchers think these are probably kleptoplasts. As a result, Dinophysis likely needs to continuously consume new cryptophytes to maintain healthy chloroplasts.\n\n---",
      "1.  \nDinophysis, a genus of protists, possesses chloroplasts with phycobilins that are originally derived from cryptophytes. Interestingly, these organisms do not retain the entire cryptophyte as an endosymbiont; instead, they only acquire the chloroplast itself. This captured chloroplast lacks both its nucleomorph and the outer two membranes, resulting in a simpler, double-membraned structure. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts normally need their nucleomorph for function, and Dinophysis cannot survive on its own in culture, it is suggested that the chloroplast in Dinophysis acts as a kleptoplast. In this scenario, Dinophysis must repeatedly ingest cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts as the old ones lose functionality, though this has not been fully confirmed.\n\n2.  \nThe genus Dinophysis contains chloroplasts that it acquires from cryptophyte organisms and which contain phycobilin pigments. Only the chloroplast is taken up, not the entire cryptophyte, and after acquisition, the chloroplast is reduced—its nucleomorph and two outermost membranes are lost, so only two membranes remain. Because cryptophyte chloroplasts typically rely on their nucleomorph to survive and Dinophysis can’t live long in isolation, it’s thought that these are kleptoplasts, chloroplasts stolen from prey, and that Dinophysis needs to keep consuming new cryptophytes to refresh its chloroplasts as they deteriorate, although this process hasn’t been conclusively proven.\n\n3.  \nDinophysis species carry chloroplasts, which contain phycobilins, that they obtain from cryptophytes. Unlike a full endosymbiotic relationship, Dinophysis takes only the chloroplast, discarding the nucleomorph and the outer two membranes, leaving behind just a double-membraned organelle. Because maintenance of a cryptophyte chloroplast requires the nucleomorph and Dinophysis dies when cultured by itself, researchers suspect Dinophysis chloroplasts function as kleptoplasts—borrowed and temporary chloroplasts. If true, Dinophysis must frequently feed on cryptophytes to replace expiring chloroplasts, though this idea awaits further confirmation.\n\n4.  \nMembers of the genus Dinophysis have acquired chloroplasts from cryptophytes that contain phycobilins, but they don’t retain the entire cryptophyte cell—only the chloroplast is kept. After uptake, the chloroplast is reduced to just two membranes, missing its nucleomorph and outer layers. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts need their nucleomorph to function and Dinophysis species can’t survive in culture alone, there is speculation that these chloroplasts are kleptoplasts, meaning Dinophysis must continually capture new cryptophytes to replenish its chloroplasts as old ones wear out, a process that is not yet definitively proven.",
      "**1.**  \nDinophysis species possess a chloroplast that contains phycobilin pigments, which they acquire from a type of algae called cryptophytes. Interestingly, they do not incorporate the entire cryptophyte as a symbiont, but instead only take the chloroplast, discarding its nucleomorph and the two outer membranes. This results in a chloroplast surrounded by just two membranes. Because cryptophyte chloroplasts rely on their nucleomorph to function properly, and because Dinophysis cannot survive in laboratory cultures by themselves, it is suspected—but not proven—that these are kleptoplasts. If true, this would mean that Dinophysis chloroplasts degrade over time and must be replaced by regularly ingesting new cryptophytes.\n\n**2.**  \nIn Dinophysis, the chloroplast contains phycobilins and originates from cryptophyte algae. Only the chloroplast is taken, not the whole cryptophyte, and it loses its nucleomorph and two outermost membranes, leaving just a double-membraned chloroplast. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts typically need their nucleomorph for upkeep, and Dinophysis cannot persist in laboratory-only cultures, scientists think Dinophysis might use kleptoplasts. If this is the case, these chloroplasts eventually stop working, and Dinophysis must repeatedly obtain new chloroplasts by consuming more cryptophytes.\n\n**3.**  \nDinophysis organisms have a unique chloroplast that comes from a cryptophyte and contains phycobilins. The chloroplast is not transferred along with the whole cryptophyte cell; rather, it is removed from the cryptophyte, shedding its nucleomorph and two outer membranes and leaving just two membranes. Because chloroplasts from cryptophytes typically need their nucleomorph to function, and Dinophysis can't survive on their own in lab cultures, researchers suspect the chloroplasts are kleptoplasts—organelles stolen from other cells. As these chloroplasts wear out, Dinophysis may need to keep acquiring new ones through feeding on cryptophytes.\n\n**4.**  \nMembers of the genus Dinophysis utilize chloroplasts that contain phycobilins and are sourced from cryptophytes. Nevertheless, instead of keeping the entire cryptophyte cell, Dinophysis retains only the chloroplast, which is missing its nucleomorph and the two outermost layers, so only two membranes remain. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts need a nucleomorph to sustain themselves, and Dinophysis species can't be maintained in culture independently, it's likely, though unconfirmed, that their chloroplasts are kleptoplasts. If so, the chloroplasts degrade with time, requiring Dinophysis to continually engulf new cryptophytes to refresh their supply of functional chloroplasts.",
      "**Rewritten passages:**\n\nMembers of the genus Dinophysis possess chloroplasts that contain phycobilins, which they acquire from cryptophyte algae. Unlike typical endosymbiosis, only the chloroplasts are taken up—without retaining the cryptophyte as a whole organism. These borrowed chloroplasts lack their usual nucleomorph and the two outermost membranes, so only a two-membraned chloroplast remains. Normally, cryptophyte chloroplasts need their nucleomorph to function, and Dinophysis can't survive in culture by themselves, implying that Dinophysis may use kleptoplasty. If that's the case, their chloroplasts eventually stop working and must be replaced by engulfing new cryptophytes.\n\nDinophysis species have specialized chloroplasts containing phycobilin, obtained from cryptophyte algae. Instead of hosting the entire cryptophyte as a symbiotic partner, Dinophysis only captures the chloroplast, which loses both its nucleomorph and outer membranes in the process, resulting in a chloroplast with just two membranes. Since cryptophyte chloroplasts generally require the nucleomorph to function properly and Dinophysis can’t survive long-term in isolation, scientists think that their chloroplasts might be kleptoplasts. This would mean Dinophysis needs to consume fresh cryptophytes regularly to replenish its chloroplasts.\n\nIn Dinophysis, the chloroplasts are unique because they come from cryptophytes and contain phycobilins, yet the association is not a full endosymbiosis. Only the chloroplast, stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost layers, is incorporated, so it has just two membranes. Typically, cryptophyte chloroplasts rely on the nucleomorph for maintenance, and Dinophysis can't survive separately in culture, suggesting that their chloroplasts may act as kleptoplasts. If confirmed, this would mean Dinophysis constantly needs to ingest cryptophytes to replace worn-out chloroplasts.\n\nDinophysis organisms have gained phycobilin-rich chloroplasts from cryptophytes, but unlike classic endosymbionts, they don’t house the entire cryptophyte. They take only the chloroplast, which has been reduced by losing its nucleomorph and two outer membranes, keeping just two membranes. Because cryptophyte chloroplasts depend on the nucleomorph, and Dinophysis cannot live long on their own, one theory is that these are kleptoplasts—stolen chloroplasts that need frequent replacement as they deteriorate, requiring Dinophysis to keep engulfing new cryptophytes."

Granal thylakoids look like circular, pancake-like disks measuring 300–600 nanometers across. Stromal thylakoids, on the other hand, wind around the grana in spiral, helicoidal sheets. The upper and lower surfaces of granal thylakoids include only a flat protein complex, photosystem II, making it possible for the thylakoids to form tight stacks.

WWSB and WOTV exist to cover areas where the main ABC affiliate’s signal is weak; for instance, WWSB serves the southern Tampa region, including Sarasota, due to past transmitter issues with the former primary affiliate, WTSP, which had to avoid interfering with Miami’s WPLG on the same channel.\n\n2.  \nABC stands out for having independently owned affiliates operating within the same viewing areas in certain places: WFTS-TV and WWSB in Tampa, and WZZM and WOTV in Grand Rapids. Kansas City also sees this unusual situation with KMBC-TV and KQTV.

WWSB and WOTV fill coverage gaps where their regions don’t get a strong signal from the main network affiliate.

Although KQTV is located in St. Joseph, Missouri, Nielsen treats it as a separate market from Kansas City, even though they’re only about 55 miles apart.

KQTV, though licensed to St. Joseph, Missouri—a distinct Nielsen market—is only about 55 miles from Kansas City. Additionally, WWSB and WOTV cover regions that the main ABC affiliates in their markets cannot adequately reach. For example, WWSB has served Sarasota and the southern Tampa area since the days before 1994, when WTSP was Tampa’s main ABC affiliate, as WTSP’s transmitter location was restricted to prevent signal interference with Miami’s WPLG, both broadcasting on VHF channel 10.\n\n2.  \nABC stands out among networks due to its arrangement of having different owners operate affiliates in the same market in Tampa (WFTS-TV and WWSB), Grand Rapids (WZZM and WOTV), and a similar situation in the Kansas City region (KMBC-TV and KQTV).

Even though St. Joseph is officially its own market, it's geographically very close to Kansas City.

A comparable arrangement is seen in Kansas City, Missouri, where KMBC-TV and KQTV both serve the area, even though KQTV is licensed in St. Joseph, Missouri, which Nielsen recognizes as a separate market from Kansas City, despite their proximity. The reason for having multiple affiliates in places like Tampa and Grand Rapids is that certain parts of these areas cannot pick up the main ABC station’s signal; in Tampa’s case, WWSB has long provided coverage for Sarasota and surrounding regions, as WTSP’s transmitter had to be situated away from Miami’s WPLG to avoid interference, since both used channel 10 on VHF.\n\n3.  \nThe American Broadcasting Company is notable for having dual, independently owned affiliates serving the same areas in both Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV).

WWSB and WOTV exist because some regions in their markets don't get a sufficient signal from the main ABC station.

Kansas City also has a similar relationship with KMBC-TV and KQTV, though KQTV is officially based in St. Joseph—a separate Nielsen-designated market located less than 55 miles away. Affiliates such as WWSB and WOTV cover areas where the primary ABC affiliate’s signal does not reach well.

Kansas City presents a comparable scenario with KMBC-TV and KQTV, the latter serving nearby St. Joseph, a market considered separate by Nielsen even though it's just 55 miles away. Some affiliates, such as WWSB and WOTV, were established to serve territories where the main market station’s signal was inadequate. In Tampa’s case, WWSB came about because WTSP’s transmitter placement, required to avoid interfering with the Miami affiliate’s signal, left southern parts of the Tampa market, including Sarasota, underserved.\n\n4.  \nABC is unusual among TV networks for having separately owned affiliates in the same city, such as in Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV).

WWSB and WOTV provide service to regions that the primary market affiliate can't reach effectively.

Some stations like WWSB and WOTV were established to broadcast to areas where the main affiliate's signal doesn't reach—WWSB's case in the Tampa area is due to transmitter placement changes needed to avoid overlap with Miami’s WPLG, both broadcasting on channel 10.\n\n3.  \nWhat sets the American Broadcasting Company apart is its use of independently operated affiliate stations that sometimes overlap in the same market, as seen in Tampa (WFTS-TV and WWSB) and Grand Rapids (WZZM and WOTV). Kansas City presents a similar scenario, with KMBC-TV and KQTV, even though KQTV is officially in St. Joseph—a nearby city classified as a separate TV market. WWSB and WOTV target communities that can't pick up the usual affiliate's broadcast, which, for Sarasota and Tampa, happened because WTSP’s transmitter needed to avoid interfering with Miami's WPLG, both operating on channel 10.\n\n4.  \nABC stands out among networks for having certain cities where two separately owned and operated affiliate stations serve the same area—Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB) and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV) being notable examples, with Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV) facing a similar case. Although KQTV is licensed to St. Joseph, Nielsen regards it as outside Kansas City's market, despite their proximity. Some affiliates, like WWSB and WOTV, fill coverage gaps where the main station’s signal is weak—WWSB's introduction to serve Sarasota and southern Tampa originated when WTSP’s transmitter had to be strategically located to prevent channel interference with WPLG in Miami."

Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.

      "1.  \nModern primality tests for numbers can be split into two major types: probabilistic (also called “Monte Carlo”) and deterministic methods. Deterministic algorithms, like trial division, always give a definite answer about whether a number is prime or composite. Probabilistic tests, by contrast, are usually faster but only give a high probability that a number is prime, not complete certainty. These rely on random testing; for a composite number, such a test might still pass some of the time. If we repeat the test multiple times and always get a pass, the chance that the number is actually composite shrinks exponentially with each test, making us nearly (but not totally) certain it’s prime. However, if the test fails even once, we know it’s composite.\n\n2.  \nPrimality tests for a number n generally fit into two categories: deterministic algorithms, which offer definite results, and probabilistic algorithms, which are faster but less certain. Deterministic tests, such as trial division, can conclusively determine if a number is prime or composite. Probabilistic tests conduct random checks that are likely (but not guaranteed) to identify non-primes, so repeating the test multiple times can make us increasingly confident that a number is prime, although we can never be completely sure. A single failed test, however, confirms that the number is not prime.\n\n3.  \nTo check if a number is prime, mathematicians use either deterministic or probabilistic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms like trial division provide absolute certainty, always correctly labeling numbers as prime or composite. Probabilistic methods, while faster, only give a probability that a number is prime because they use random elements in testing. If a number passes the probabilistic test repeatedly, our confidence in its primality grows, as the chance of it being composite shrinks rapidly. Still, absolute certainty only comes from deterministic methods, and any failure in the probabilistic test reveals the number is composite.",
      "1.  \nPrimality tests for numbers n can generally be grouped into two types: deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) algorithms. Deterministic methods, like trial division, guarantee whether a number is prime or composite when done properly. In contrast, probabilistic algorithms are usually faster but cannot fully confirm a number’s primality. These probabilistic tests operate partly at random: a prime number will always pass, while a composite number passes with some probability p. If the test is repeated n times and passes each time, the likelihood the number is composite drops to 1/(1-p)n, making us increasingly confident in its primality—but not absolutely certain. However, if the test fails at any point, the number is definitely composite.\n\n2.  \nThere are two principal categories of modern primality tests for numbers n: deterministic algorithms and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) algorithms. Deterministic algorithms, such as trial division, can definitively determine if a number is prime, as they always produce the correct result if conducted correctly. Probabilistic methods, on the other hand, tend to be quicker but only provide a high probability—not a certainty—that a number is prime. These algorithms rely on random processes, so a prime will always pass the test, but a composite number only passes with probability p. Repeating the test n times reduces the chance a composite is mistaken for prime to 1/(1-p)n, allowing for great confidence, though never total certainty. If a failure occurs during any test, the number is confirmed as composite.\n\n3.  \nModern methods for checking if a number n is prime mostly fall into either probabilistic (also called \"Monte Carlo\") or deterministic categories. Deterministic algorithms, like trial division, can conclusively state whether a number is prime or not. Probabilistic tests are usually much faster, but they never offer absolute proof—a number passes the test with some probability, and multiple repetitions of the test make it more likely (but never certain) that the number is actually prime. If a prime number is tested, it always passes, but for a composite, it may pass with probability p. Running the test n times means a composite number has only a 1/(1-p)n chance of slipping through undetected, so confidence increases with each iteration. However, a single test failure means the number is definitely composite.\n\n4.  \nTo determine whether a number n is prime, mathematicians use two main types of algorithms: deterministic and probabilistic (or Monte Carlo). Deterministic algorithms, such as trial division, are reliable and will always give a definite answer about a number’s primality. Probabilistic algorithms, though usually faster, only provide a statistical likelihood that a number is prime, based on random sampling. They work so that a prime number always passes, but a composite passes with chance p. When the test is repeated n times without failure, the probability that the number is composite drops sharply to 1/(1-p)n. While this method gives increasing confidence in a number's primality, it never reaches complete certainty, unless a test fails—which conclusively proves the number is composite.",
      "1.  \nModern methods to check if a number **n** is prime are generally sorted into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic (or \"Monte Carlo\") algorithms. Deterministic methods give a definite answer about whether a number is prime—for instance, trial division always tells correctly if a number is prime or composite. In contrast, probabilistic algorithms are usually quicker but don't offer absolute certainty. These work by running partially random tests. A prime number will almost always pass these tests, whereas a composite number has a probability **p** of passing. If we repeat the test **n** times and keep passing, the chance that the number is still composite drops to 1/(1-p)^n, decreasing rapidly as tests increase, so we can become very confident (though never fully certain) a number is prime. But if the test fails once, the number is definitely composite.\n\n2.  \nPrimality tests for a general number **n** fall into two main types: probabilistic and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms, such as trial division, always give a clear and correct result—identifying whether a number is truly prime or composite. Probabilistic tests, on the other hand, often work quicker but only provide a high probability (not absolute proof) of primality. These tests use some randomization, so while a prime passes every time, a composite might pass with a certain probability **p**. Repeating the test many times and passing each time means the chance it's composite drops exponentially, to 1/(1-p)^n after n successful tests. Still, a single failed test is enough to confirm the number is not prime.\n\n3.  \nTo check if any number **n** is prime, modern algorithms are divided into two broad types: deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo). Deterministic tests, like trial division, unfailingly tell you whether the number is prime or not. Probabilistic tests, in contrast, are faster and use random sampling, but can only offer an extremely high likelihood rather than certainty. They work by giving every prime a guaranteed pass, but composites a chance **p** to slip through. If a number passes **n** rounds of testing, the odds that it's actually composite become as small as 1/(1-p)^n, making us very confident, though not absolutely certain. However, a single failed test is definite proof that the number is composite.\n\n4.  \nThere are two primary kinds of algorithms to decide if a number **n** is prime: deterministic and probabilistic (also called \"Monte Carlo\"). Deterministic algorithms like trial division always deliver the correct answer regarding a number's primality. Probabilistic algorithms, while generally faster, can't guarantee certainty—they use random choices so that a prime always passes but a composite only passes with a given probability **p**. Passing the test repeatedly sharpens our confidence; after **n** successful runs, the likelihood the number is composite shrinks dramatically, as 1/(1-p)^n. Nevertheless, failing the test even once confirms the number is composite.",

For example, a probabilistic test will always succeed on a prime number, but it may also succeed on a composite number with some chance p. Performing the test multiple times decreases the likelihood that a composite number is mistaken for prime, as the probability becomes 1/(1-p)^n.

For primes, these tests always pass, but for composites, they pass with some probability p.

      "**1.**  \nThere are two main types of modern primality tests for checking if a number n is prime: deterministic and probabilistic (also called \"Monte Carlo\") algorithms. Deterministic algorithms always give a definite answer about whether a number is prime or composite; trial division is a classic example and will never misclassify a number if used correctly. Probabilistic tests, on the other hand, work more quickly but can't provide absolute certainty that a number is prime. They involve testing numbers in random ways, and while they always identify primes, they might mistakenly flag composites as primes with some probability p. If you repeat such a test n times without failure, the chance the number is actually composite becomes 1/(1-p)^n, which drops exponentially as n increases, making us increasingly confident (but never totally certain) about the number being prime. If any test fails, we can conclusively say the number is composite.\n\n**2.**  \nModern tests for determining if a number n is prime fall into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) algorithms. Deterministic approaches, like trial division, provide definitive answers and will always correctly tell whether a number is prime or not. Probabilistic algorithms are generally faster but can only provide strong evidence, not proof, of primality. They use random or semi-random choices in their checks. A probabilistic test may always pass when applied to a prime, but only pass with a certain probability p for a composite. If repeated n times without failure, the likelihood of mistakenly identifying a composite as prime falls to 1/(1-p)^n, rapidly reducing the chance of error. However, a single failed test is enough to confirm the number is composite.\n\n**3.**  \nTo check if a number is prime, mathematicians use two types of modern algorithms: deterministic ones, which always give a sure answer, and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) ones, which give a probable answer faster. Deterministic algorithms, such as checking by trial division, will always correctly determine if a number is prime or not. Probabilistic algorithms use random methods and may identify a composite number as prime with some probability p. If a number passes the probabilistic test n times, the chance it’s actually composite shrinks to 1/(1-p)^n, becoming smaller with every test, although absolute certainty isn’t possible. Nevertheless, if the test ever fails, the number must be composite.\n\n**4.**  \nPrimality testing for numbers today is done using either deterministic algorithms, which guarantee correct identification, or probabilistic algorithms, which are faster but only give a very high probability. Trial division is an example of a deterministic method that will always classify numbers correctly. Probabilistic, or Monte Carlo, algorithms test numbers in a random fashion: they might always succeed for primes, but only succeed with probability p for composites. After n successful tests, the odds a composite number was mistakenly identified become 1/(1-p)^n—a chance that shrinks exponentially with each attempt. However, if any test fails, the number is confirmed composite."

In 1941, he founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party and led it until 1972. Nevertheless, Maududi made his most significant impact through his writings, which were highly influential, translated into numerous languages, and helped place Islam in a modern framework. His ideas influenced not only conservative religious scholars but also more liberal Islamist thinkers like al-Faruqi, whose concept of the \"Islamization of Knowledge\" extended Maududi's key principles.\n\n2.  \nAn influential figure in the early 1900s Islamic resurgence in India, Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi later played a crucial role in Pakistan’s Islamic thought after its independence. Despite a legal education, Maududi chose journalism, writing extensively about contemporary issues, with a notable emphasis on Islam and its legal system. He established the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and led it until 1972. However, his most lasting influence came from his widely read books, which framed Islam in a modern light and affected not just traditional scholars but also progressive Islamists like al-Faruqi, who advanced Maududi’s ideas through the \"Islamization of Knowledge.\"\n\n3.  \nSayyid Abul Ala Maududi emerged as a key leader in both India's early twentieth-century Islamic revival and Pakistan's post-independence religious scene. With a background in law, he became a journalist, focusing his writings on current affairs and, above all, on Islam and its laws. Maududi established the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and led it until 1972, but his real influence came through his writing. His books, translated into many languages, recast Islam for the modern era and inspired a range of Islamist thinkers, from traditional scholars to reformists like al-Faruqi, who continued Maududi’s legacy with his project for the \"Islamization of Knowledge.\"\n\n4.  \nA major force in Islamic revivalism, Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi began his work in early twentieth-century India and continued to shape religious thought in Pakistan after 1947. Although educated as a lawyer, he became widely known for his journalism and his focus on issues of Islamic law. In 1941, he founded Jamaat-e-Islami, leading the party for three decades, but his greatest impact was through his widely translated writings. These works brought Islamic principles into the modern discourse and deeply influenced both traditionalist scholars and innovative Islamists like al-Faruqi, whose vision of the \"Islamization of Knowledge\" built on Maududi’s foundational concepts.",

Moreover, the relationship between the zeta function and primes is further illustrated by Euler’s solution to the Basel problem, which hints at the depth of modern algebraic number theory.\n\n2. Prime numbers are intimately linked to the zeta function. As one example, it's possible to prove there are infinitely many primes through the zeta function: if there were just finitely many primes, ζ(1) would sum to a finite number, contradicting the fact that the harmonic series diverges. Therefore, infinite primes must exist. Euler's identity from the Basel problem is another demonstration of the zeta function's mathematical richness and its ties to number theory.\n\n3. The relationship between the zeta function and prime numbers is quite profound.

This unique chloroplast arose through a process known as serial secondary endosymbiosis, where a green alga with a primary chloroplast became an endosymbiont, forming a secondary chloroplast, not via tertiary endosymbiosis.\n\n4.  \nThe dinophyte Lepidodinium viride and its closest relatives replaced their typical peridinin-type chloroplast with one that comes from a green alga (specifically a prasinophyte). Lepidodinium stands out as the only dinophyte with a chloroplast that does not have a rhodoplast origin. Its chloroplast is enclosed by two membranes and contains no nucleomorph, because all the associated nucleomorph genes are now found within the dinophyte’s own nucleus. The event that gave rise to this chloroplast involved serial secondary endosymbiosis, not tertiary endosymbiosis—the green algal endosymbiont already had a primary chloroplast, resulting in a secondary chloroplast in Lepidodinium.",
      "1.  \nLepidodinium viride and its relatives are dinoflagellates that lost their original peridinin-type chloroplasts and instead acquired chloroplasts originating from green algae, specifically prasinophytes. Uniquely, Lepidodinium is the only dinoflagellate with a chloroplast not derived from the red algal lineage. This chloroplast is encased by two membranes and lacks a nucleomorph, as all nucleomorph-related genes have been integrated into the host's nucleus. The origin of this chloroplast is due to serial secondary endosymbiosis, involving the engulfment of a green alga already containing a primary chloroplast, rather than a process called tertiary endosymbiosis.\n\n2.  \nIn Lepidodinium viride and its close kin, the original peridinin chloroplast was lost and substituted with one from a green alga, more precisely a prasinophyte. This replacement makes Lepidodinium stand out among dinophytes, as it is the only one with a chloroplast not descended from the rhodoplast group. The chloroplast has a double membrane structure and does not contain a nucleomorph, since all nucleomorph genes have moved to the dinophyte’s nuclear genome. The chloroplast’s history traces back to serial secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga, meaning the engulfed organism already possessed a primary chloroplast, creating a secondary chloroplast.\n\n3.  \nThe dinophyte Lepidodinium viride, along with related species, replaced its ancestral peridinin chloroplast with one obtained from a green alga called a prasinophyte. Notably, Lepidodinium is unique among dinophytes because its chloroplast does not originate from a red algal lineage. This chloroplast is notable for having two membranes and for lacking a nucleomorph, since genetic content from this structure has transferred to the host’s nucleus. The process that gave rise to this chloroplast is called serial secondary endosymbiosis, where a green alga containing a primary chloroplast was engulfed, resulting in a secondary chloroplast."

      "1.  \nTerra preta, or \"black earth,\" is found across broad regions of the Amazon rainforest and is now recognized as the result of indigenous peoples’ advanced soil management techniques. This rich and fertile earth enabled both farming and forestry in an area that was once thought to be inhospitable. As a result, much of the Amazon’s landscape may have been shaped over centuries by human activity, not solely by natural forces as long believed. In 2003, Michael Heckenberger and his team from the University of Florida discovered traces of sizable ancient settlements in the Xingu tribal area, including roads, bridges, and large plazas.\n\n2.  \nWidespread throughout the Amazon, terra preta (\"black earth\") is now understood to be the outcome of traditional soil practices by indigenous communities. Its creation made agriculture and forest management possible in a region once considered too challenging for such activities. This suggests that vast parts of the Amazon rainforest could be the legacy of centuries of human influence, contrary to previous beliefs about its untouched nature. In 2003, researchers led by Michael Heckenberger in the Xingu region uncovered remnants of major settlements, such as roads, bridges, and big open plazas.\n\n3.  \nThe \"black earth\" known as terra preta is scattered across large swathes of the Amazon and is currently seen as a testament to indigenous soil engineering. Because this fertile soil supported farming and tree cultivation in otherwise difficult surroundings, it implies that much of the Amazon rainforests landscape was likely shaped by generations of human management rather than being purely natural. Evidence of this, including structures like roads, bridges and significant plazas, was uncovered in 2003 by University of Florida’s Michael Heckenberger and co-researchers in the Xingu area.\n\n4.  \nTerra preta, or black earth, covers extensive areas in the Amazon and is now largely regarded as the product of indigenous management methods. This exceptionally fertile soil facilitated agriculture and tree cultivation where it would not have otherwise thrived, indicating that humans have played a substantial role in shaping the forest. Supporting this idea, Michael Heckenberger and his team found archaeological traces of vast settlements—including roads, bridges, and large communal spaces—among the Xingu people’s territory in 2003.",

The discovery in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger’s team of settlement ruins, such as roads and large plazas, in the Xingu region supports this perspective.\n\n4. The presence of terra preta, or black earth, throughout large parts of the Amazon rainforest is now credited to indigenous practices of soil enrichment. These efforts allowed for farming and the cultivation of trees in areas otherwise difficult to inhabit, which suggests the Amazon’s current state may be largely due to prolonged human influence rather than purely natural evolution.

      "1. Since about 3000 years ago, human activities began influencing the Rhine delta. With the rise of Bronze Age agriculture and increasing clearing of land in the central German uplands, the Rhine’s sediment load increased, causing the delta to grow faster. This led to more frequent flooding and sediment deposition, which stopped peat formation in the delta. The main way sediment was spread across the delta was through the shifting of river channels, a process called avulsion. Around 80 avulsions have happened in the past 6000 years. Human intervention in the delta started during Roman times with peat mining for salt and fuel. Later, in the 11th to 13th centuries, people built embankments along the main river branches and dammed minor ones. Canal digging, bend cutting, and the construction of groynes followed to keep river channels stable and free from silt.\n\n2. Human influence on the Rhine delta became evident around 3000 years before present, coinciding with Bronze Age land clearing in upland areas of central Germany. This increased erosion and the flow of sediment in the Rhine, accelerating the delta’s expansion. As a result, flooding and sedimentation intensified, halting the growth of peat in the delta. The main process distributing this sediment was avulsion, where river channels frequently changed course across the floodplain. Over the last 6000 years, about 80 such avulsions have shaped the delta. After the Romans began mining peat for salt and fuel, direct human modification of the delta increased. During the 11th to 13th centuries, people built embankments on major channels, dammed minor ones, and soon after, constructed canals, straightened river bends, and added groynes to prevent channel migration and silting.\n\n3. Around 3000 years ago, humans began to significantly affect the Rhine delta. The expansion of Bronze Age farming and land clearance in central Germany led to more sediment being carried by the Rhine, which quickened the delta's growth. Flooding and sedimentation became more frequent, which put an end to peat accumulation in the area. The most important mechanism for spreading sediment in the subrecent delta was avulsion, where the river switched channels across the floodplain. Roughly 80 channel shifts, or avulsions, have been recorded in the past 6000 years. Human activities such as peat mining for salt and fuel started in the Roman era. Later, embankment of main river branches, damming of minor channels, and the creation of canals, cutoff bends, and groynes occurred during the medieval period to manage the river’s movement and prevent silting.",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each in slightly different style and structure:\n\n---\n\n**Version 1:**  \nHuman activity in the Rhine delta has been evident since around 3000 years Before Present (BP). The clearance of land for agriculture during the Bronze Age in central Germany led to a substantial rise in the Rhine’s sediment load, accelerating the growth of the delta. This process increased flooding and sediment buildup, which halted peat formation in the region. Avulsions—the shifting of river channels over the floodplain—became the primary way sediment was distributed. Approximately 80 avulsions have shaped the delta over the last 6000 years. Direct intervention began during Roman times with peat mining for salt and fuel. In the 11th to 13th centuries, embankments were constructed on main channels and smaller distributaries were dammed. Later, humans further altered the landscape by digging canals, straightening river bends, and building groynes to keep the river’s course stable and prevent silting.\n\n---\n\n**Version 2:**  \nSince about 3000 years ago, human influence on the Rhine delta has been apparent. When upland regions in central Germany were cleared for agriculture during the Bronze Age, the river began carrying more sediment, which sped up delta expansion. The consequence was more frequent flooding, increased sediment deposition, and the cessation of peat development in the delta. The movement of river channels, known as avulsion, was the main factor spreading sediment across the delta in this period, with roughly 80 avulsions occurring over six millennia. Peat extraction for salt and energy began in the Roman era, marking the beginning of direct human modification. During the 11th to 13th centuries CE, embankments and dams were constructed on major and minor channels, while later innovations such as canals, cut-offs, and groynes were introduced to control river migration and prevent silt buildup.\n\n---\n\n**Version 3:**  \nThe Rhine delta shows evidence of human impact starting approximately 3000 years ago. Agricultural expansion in the upland areas during the Bronze Age led to an increase in the amount of sediment carried by the river, causing the delta to grow faster. This enhanced flooding and sedimentation, stopping further peat formation. Over the last 6000 years, around 80 instances of avulsion—the shifting of river channels—have helped spread sediments throughout the delta. Human activities intensified from Roman times with peat mining for resources, followed by extensive embankment and damming in the Middle Ages. Later engineering efforts included the creation of canals and groynes to maintain the river’s course and manage sedimentation.\n\n---\n\n**Version 4:**  \nAround 3000 years Before Present, human activity began to significantly affect the Rhine delta. Bronze Age agriculture in central Germany increased land clearance, which in turn raised sediment loads and sped up delta formation. This led to more frequent floods and more sediment accumulation, halting the formation of peat. The primary way sediment was spread was through avulsion, or the movement of river channels, a process that has happened about 80 times in the past 6000 years. Direct impacts like peat mining date back to Roman times, followed by the construction of embankments and dams in the 11–13th centuries. Later, the river was further engineered with dug canals and groynes to keep its channels stable and free from silt.\n\n---",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage, each written differently:\n\n**1.**  \nSince about 3000 years ago, humans have left their mark on the Rhine delta. As Bronze Age communities in central Germany cleared more land for farming, the amount of sediment carried by the Rhine river increased significantly, accelerating delta growth. This led to more frequent flooding and and thicker layers of sediment, ultimately stopping peat formation. Often, the main way sediment spread through the younger delta was when the river channels shifted to new paths across the floodplain—a process known as avulsion. In the last 6000 years, nearly 80 such shifts have been recorded. People began directly altering the delta Roman times by mining peat for salt and fuel. Major distributaries were later embanked and minor ones dammed during the 11th to 13th centuries. Subsequently, canals were constructed, river bends were straightened, and groynes installed, all to stabilize the river’s channels and prevent silting or changes in their course.  \n\n**2.**  \nHuman influence on the Rhine delta dates back to around 3000 years before present. The advent of agriculture during the Bronze Age in central Germany led to increased deforestation and land use, boosting sediment transport by the river and accelerating delta expansion. Greater flooding and sedimentation ensued, bringing an end to peat accumulation in the area. The most important sediment distribution process became avulsion, where rivers changed course on the floodplain. Around 80 avulsions have taken place over the past six millennia. Direct transformation of the delta began with peat extraction in Roman times, later followed by the construction of embankments for major and dams for minor distributaries during medieval times (11th–13th centuries AD). Next, people dug canals, straightened river bends, and built groynes to keep the river in place and prevent silting.  \n\n**3.**  \nIn the Rhine delta, evidence of human activity first appears about three thousand years ago. As Bronze Age farmers increased land clearing in the uplands of central Germany, the river carried more sediment and the delta grew more rapidly. The resulting higher sediment deposition and frequent floods put an end to peat development. The main mechanism for spreading sediment was avulsion, or the switching of river channels across the floodplain. In total, 80 avulsions have taken place in the last 6000 years. Direct human alteration in the delta began during Roman times with peat mining. Later, in the 11th to 13th centuries, people built embankments along major channels and dammed minor ones. In the following centuries, they also built canals, straightened meanders, and installed groynes to keep the river channels stable and clear.  \n\n**4.**  \nHuman activities have shaped the Rhine delta since at least 3000 years ago. During the Bronze Age, as upland regions in central Germany were cleared for agriculture, sediment loads increased sharply, and the delta’s expansion accelerated. This resulted in more flooding and sediment accumulation, putting a stop to peat formation. Avulsions, or the rerouting of river channels on the floodplain, became the main way sediment was spread in the younger delta, with approximately 80 of these events happening in the last 6000 years. Direct effects of human actions began with the mining of peat for fuel and salt in Roman times, followed by the embankment of major river branches and the damming of smaller ones between the 11th and 13th centuries. Afterward, engineering works such as canal digging, river straightening, and groyne construction were undertaken to keep the river from shifting or filling with silt.",
      "1.  \nStarting around 3000 years ago, human activities began to noticeably affect the Rhine delta. As people cleared more land for Bronze Age farming in central Germany, the river carried more sediment, causing the delta to expand at a faster rate. This led to increased flooding and sediment build-up, which put an end to peat formation in the delta. The main way sediment spread was through avulsions, where the river shifted its channels across the floodplain; about 80 of these avulsions have happened in the last 6000 years.

Further modifications included digging canals, straightening river bends, and constructing groynes to keep the river from changing course or filling with silt.\n\n2.  \nAround 3000 years before present, evidence of human influence becomes apparent in the Rhine delta. Increased land clearance for Bronze Age agriculture in central Germany led to higher sediment loads in the Rhine, accelerating delta expansion. This increase caused more frequent flooding and sedimentation, eventually halting the formation of peat in the delta. Avulsion, or the shifting of river channels, played the biggest role in spreading sediment throughout the delta, with roughly 80 such events over the past 6000 years. Direct human effects began in Roman times with the extraction of peat for salt and fuel. The 11th to 13th centuries saw the construction of embankments on major river branches and dams on smaller distributaries. In subsequent years, humans dug canals, straightened river curves, and built groynes to stabilize the river's paths.\n\n3.  \nHuman activities have influenced the Rhine delta since roughly 3000 years before present. With the expansion of agriculture in the Bronze Age in central Germany, more land was cleared, and the Rhine started carrying much more sediment, quickening the growth of the delta. This resulted in more flooding, more sediment, and the cessation of peat formation. Movement of river channels through a process called avulsion was key to distributing sediment, with about 80 avulsions recorded in 6000 years. Starting in Roman times, people directly changed the delta by mining peat for resources like salt and fuel. This was succeeded by construction of embankments for the main branches, damming of minor branches in the 11th to 13th centuries, and further by digging canals, straightening bends, and building groynes to manage river channel stability.",
      "Certainly! Here are several rewritten versions of the passage you provided, each separated by a newline:\n\n---\n\nSince around 3000 years Before Present, human activities have made an impact on the Rhine delta. As Bronze Age societies in central Germany cleared more land for agriculture, the sediment carried by the Rhine increased, accelerating the growth of the delta. This resulted in more frequent flooding and sediment buildup, which put an end to peat formation in the delta region. The main way sediment was spread throughout the recent delta was through avulsions, or shifts of river channels to different parts of the floodplain. Over the last 6000 years, about 80 of these avulsions occurred. Human intervention became direct when people began mining peat for salt and fuel during Roman times. In the 11th to 13th centuries, major distributary channels were embanked, and minor distributaries were dammed. Later modifications included digging canals, straightening bends, and building groynes to prevent channel movement and sedimentation.\n\n---\n\nHuman influence on the Rhine delta has been evident since approximately 3000 years ago. The expansion of agriculture in central Germany during the Bronze Age led to greater land clearance, increasing the sediment the river transported. This, in turn, sped up delta growth, brought about more flooding and sediment deposits, and stopped peat accumulation. The main mechanism for spreading sediments across the delta was avulsion, where the river changes course on the floodplain. Over the past six millennia, around 80 such events have taken place. Peat mining, which began in Roman times to extract salt and fuel, marked the start of significant human intervention. In the 11th to 13th centuries, humans constructed embankments along major river branches and dammed smaller ones; subsequent projects included digging canals, cutting off bends, and adding groynes to control river movement and prevent silting.\n\n---\n\nStarting about 3000 years before today, the Rhine delta began to show signs of human impact. The gradual deforestation for Bronze Age farming in central Germany increased the Rhine's sediment load, making the delta expand more rapidly. This growth led to more frequent floods and heavier sediment deposits, which halted the natural formation of peat. Avulsions—events where the river changed its course—were the primary way sediment was distributed throughout the delta in the recent period. Approximately 80 avulsions have occurred over the last 6000 years. The first direct human impact came during Roman times, when people started mining peat for salt and fuel. This was followed by the construction of embankments along major channels and the damming of minor channels between the 11th and 13th centuries. Afterward, extensive works such as canal digging, bend cutting, and building groynes were undertaken to keep the river's channels stable and free from sediment.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need more rewritings or a specific style!"

As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD.
