      "**Question 1:** Why was the Shah's army unable to effectively resist the Mongol invasion?\n\n**Answer 1:** The Shah's army was unable to effectively resist the Mongol invasion because it was weakened by internal feuds and by the Shah’s decision to divide his forces into small groups stationed in different cities. This fragmentation made it easier for the Mongols to defeat these smaller groups one by one, instead of facing a united defense.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** What advantage did the Mongols gain from the fragmentation of the Khwarzemi forces?\n\n**Answer 2:** The fragmentation allowed the Mongols to fight against small, isolated portions of the Khwarzemi army, rather than a single unified army, enabling the Mongols to quickly defeat these smaller groups even though they themselves were exhausted from their long journey.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** How did the Mongols capture the town of Otrar?\n\n**Answer 3:** The Mongols captured the town of Otrar by using superior military strategy and tactics.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** What did Genghis Khan do to the people of Otrar after its capture?\n\n**Answer 4:** After capturing Otrar, Genghis Khan ordered the massacre of many civilians, enslaved the remaining population, and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes as punishment for his actions.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:** What happened to the Shah near the end of the battle?\n\n**Answer 5:** Near the end of the battle, the Shah fled instead of surrendering.\n\n---\n\n**Question 6:** What orders did Genghis Khan give to Subutai and Jebe, and what was the outcome for the Shah?\n\n**Answer 6:** Genghis Khan ordered Subutai and Jebe to pursue the Shah, providing them with 20,000 men and two years to complete their mission.

      "**Question 1:** Do Directives of the European Union generally allow citizens to sue other citizens directly based on their provisions?\n\n**Answer 1:** No, Directives do not generally give citizens standing to sue other citizens directly. Instead, Directives are addressed to member states, which are responsible for implementing them into national law. Citizens can usually only make claims based on the national laws that implement the Directives, not the Directives themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** Why do Directives not usually have direct effect between non-state parties?\n\n**Answer 2:** Directives do not usually have direct effect between non-state parties (also known as \"horizontal\" direct effect) because TFEU article 288 states that Directives are addressed to member states and leave the choice of form and methods to the national authorities. This means that Directives typically set minimum standards that must be implemented by national governments, and do not themselves create enforceable rights and duties for individuals against other individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** Can you give an example of how a Directive sets minimum standards, but member states may require more?\n\n**Answer 3:** Yes, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks of paid holidays each year. However, most member states go beyond this minimum and require more than 28 days of paid holiday in their own national laws.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** What is the current position of the Court of Justice regarding the direct effect of Directives?\n\n**Answer 4:** The Court of Justice currently holds that citizens can make claims based on national laws implementing Directives, but not directly from the Directives themselves. Thus, Directives do not have horizontal direct effect.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:** Has the decision to deny horizontal direct effect to Directives been controversial?\n\n**Answer 5:** Yes, this decision was instantly controversial. In the early 1990s, three Advocate Generals argued persuasively that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens. However, the Court of Justice refused this reasoning, though there are five large exceptions to the rule.",
      "**Question 1:** Do EU Directives allow citizens to sue other citizens directly under EU law?\n\n**Answer 1:** No, generally EU Directives do not give citizens standing to sue other citizens directly. Directives are addressed to member states and are meant to be implemented through national law, meaning citizens can usually only make claims based on national laws that implement the Directives, not from the Directives themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** Why are Directives addressed to member states, and not directly to individuals?\n\n**Answer 2:** According to TFEU article 288, Directives are addressed to member states because they \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" for implementation. This means member states can decide how to achieve the goals set by the Directive, often creating minimum standards that countries can exceed in their national law.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** What is an example of how Directives create minimum standards?\n\n**Answer 3:** The Working Time Directive is an example—it requires at least 4 weeks of paid holidays for every worker, but many member states go beyond this minimum by requiring more than 28 days of paid holidays in their own laws.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** What does \"horizontal direct effect\" mean, and do Directives have it?\n\n**Answer 4:** \"Horizontal direct effect\" means that a provision of law allows individuals to enforce rights against other private parties (non-state actors). Directives do not have horizontal direct effect; they only bind the member states, not individuals directly.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:** Have there been challenges or alternative viewpoints regarding the direct effect of Directives?\n\n**Answer 5:** Yes, in the early 1990s, three Advocate Generals argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens, effectively giving them horizontal direct effect. However, the Court of Justice refused this approach, though there are five major exceptions to this principle.",
      "**Question 1:** Do EU Treaties, Regulations, and Directives all have the same legal effect for citizens?\n\n**Answer 1:** No, they do not. While Treaties and Regulations can have direct effect (if their provisions are clear, unconditional, and immediate), Directives generally do not give citizens the right to sue other citizens (known as \"horizontal\" direct effect). Directives are addressed to member states, requiring them to implement the rules, often setting minimum standards, but usually do not directly create rights or obligations enforceable by individuals against each other.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** Why do Directives not usually have \"horizontal\" direct effect between citizens?\n\n**Answer 2:** According to TFEU article 288, Directives are addressed to member states, not individuals, and allow national authorities to choose how to implement them. The purpose is often to create minimum standards that member states can exceed, rather than binding individual citizens directly.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** Can citizens make legal claims based on Directives?\n\n**Answer 3:** Citizens can make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from the Directives themselves. The Court of Justice has held that Directives do not have horizontal direct effect.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** Has the lack of horizontal direct effect for Directives been controversial?\n\n**Answer 4:** Yes, it has been controversial.

Directives are addressed to member states, not individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** Why don't Directives usually allow citizens to sue each other directly?  \n**Answer 2:** Directives are addressed to member states and give them the choice of form and methods to implement the rules, as described in TFEU article 288.

While Treaties and Regulations can have direct effect if they are clear, unconditional, and immediate, Directives generally do not allow citizens to sue other citizens directly based on the Directive itself (\"horizontal\" direct effect).\n\n---\n\nQuestion 2: Why do Directives not generally have direct effect between private citizens?\n\n**Answer:**  \nDirectives do not generally have direct effect between private citizens because TFEU article 288 states that Directives are addressed to member states, not individuals, and usually leave it to the national authorities to choose the form and method of implementation. This means they tend to create minimum standards rather than direct legal rights enforceable against other private parties.\n\n---\n\nQuestion 3: How are Directives generally implemented in member states?\n\n**Answer:**  \nDirectives are typically implemented by national authorities, who have the flexibility to decide the best way to achieve the Directive’s goals. This often results in member states exceeding the minimum standards set by the Directive, as seen with the Working Time Directive, which states a minimum of 4 weeks’ paid holidays per year, but most member states grant more than this minimum.\n\n---\n\nQuestion 4: Can citizens make claims based on Directives in court?\n\n**Answer:**  \nCitizens cannot generally make claims directly based on Directives themselves, but they can bring claims based on national laws that implement Directives. The Court of Justice holds that Directives do not have horizontal direct effect (between non-state parties).\n\n---\n\nQuestion 5: Has this position about Directives been controversial?\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, the Court of Justice’s refusal to give Directives horizontal direct effect has been controversial.

He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity.

Secondary chloroplasts, on the other hand, have additional membranes outside the original two. These extra membranes result from a secondary endosymbiotic event, in which a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfs a chloroplast-containing alga but does not digest it. The engulfed alga is broken down, leaving its chloroplast and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus.

This is because, in a secondary endosymbiotic event, a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but did not digest it.

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China.

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.\n\nQuestion 1: "

The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility.

This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture.

This biological containment makes it possible for genetically modified crops to coexist with conventional and organic crops with a significantly reduced risk of cross-contamination.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** Has the reliability of chloroplast containment been demonstrated for all crop species?\n\n**Answer 3:** No, the reliability of this containment mechanism has not been studied for all relevant crop species.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** What have recent studies in tobacco plants shown about the effectiveness of transgene containment in chloroplasts?\n\n**Answer 4:** Recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a very low failed containment rate of 3 in 1,000,000 for transplastomic plants.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need more questions or further simplification!",
      "**Question 1:** Why have chloroplasts gained attention from developers of genetically modified crops?\n\n**Answer 1:** Chloroplasts have gained attention because, in most flowering plants, they are not inherited from the male parent, so transgenes inserted into chloroplasts cannot be spread by pollen. This makes plastid transformation valuable for creating genetically modified plants that are biologically contained and pose lower environmental risks.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** How does transformation of plastids contribute to environmental safety in genetically modified crops?\n\n**Answer 2:** Transformation of plastids (such as chloroplasts) allows for the containment of transgenes, as they are not spread via pollen. This biological containment minimizes environmental risks by preventing the unintentional spread of genetically modified traits to conventional or organic crops.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** What evidence supports the reliability of chloroplast transformation as a method for containment in genetically modified plants?\n\n**Answer 3:** Recent results in tobacco plants are promising, with a reported failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at only 3 in 1,000,000, suggesting that the method is highly reliable.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** Is plastid transformation and its containment approach proven in all crop species?\n\n**Answer 4:** No, the reliability of this containment mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, though current results, such as those in tobacco, are encouraging.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:** Why is this biological containment strategy important for agriculture?\n\n**Answer 5:** This biological containment strategy is important because it supports the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture by preventing the cross-contamination of genetically modified crops with other crop types.",

However, recent tests in tobacco plants are promising, showing a very low failed containment rate of 3 in 1,000,000 transplastomic plants.\n\n---\n\nQuestion 4:  \n**What do results in tobacco plants indicate about the effectiveness of plastid transformation?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nResults in tobacco plants indicate that plastid transformation is highly effective, with a failed containment rate of only 3 in 1,000,000 transplastomic plants. This suggests that the method offers strong biological containment in this species."

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a question-answer format.\n\nPassage:\nChloroplast\nRecently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of genetically modified crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.\n\nQuestion 1: "

    "title": "Imperialism",
    "context": "In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.",

Lenin, in particular, argued in his work *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism* that imperialism was a natural extension of capitalism, necessary for capitalist economies to continually expand their investment, resources, and manpower, which led to colonial expansion.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4: What shift in focus did Lenin and later Marxist theorists bring to the understanding of imperialism?**  \n**Answer:** Lenin and later Marxist theorists emphasized the structural or systemic nature of imperialism, arguing it was an inherent feature of capitalism, rather than just a policy or historical period.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5: How has the concept of imperialism changed over time among leftist theoreticians?**  \n**Answer:** Leftist theoreticians have expanded the idea of imperialism to cover a much longer historical period, seeing it as a world system stretching back centuries—sometimes as far back as Christopher Columbus and even the Crusades—instead of just a policy or a phenomenon of the late 19th century.\n\n---\n\n**Question 6: According to the passage, along what axes has the meaning of imperialism shifted as its application has expanded?**  \n**Answer:** As the concept has broadened, the meaning of imperialism has shifted along moral, economic, systemic, cultural, and temporal axes.\n\n---\n\n**Question 7: What broader sentiment does the changing meaning of imperialism reflect?**  \n**Answer:** The shifting meaning reflects, among other changes, a growing unease or discomfort with the reality of power—especially Western power.",
      "**Question 1:**  \nHow did the term \"imperialism\" enter English usage, and what did it originally describe?\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe term \"imperialism\" was introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s, initially by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was soon after adopted by supporters such as Joseph Chamberlain. The term has since evolved to be associated with various perspectives, including idealism, philanthropy, political self-interest, and capitalist greed.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:**  \nHow did theorists like John A. Hobson and Vladimir Lenin contribute to the concept of imperialism?\n\n**Answer:**  \nJohn A. Hobson and Marxist theorist Vladimir Lenin added macroeconomic theories to the concept of imperialism. Lenin, especially through his work \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,\" portrayed imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism, arising from the need for constant economic expansion, which required colonial expansion for investment, resources, and manpower. Lenin’s view significantly influenced subsequent Marxist conceptions of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:**  \nHow has the meaning and time period associated with \"imperialism\" changed over time according to the passage?\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe meaning and time frame associated with \"imperialism\" have expanded beyond a specific policy or a few decades in the late 19th century. Many leftist theorists now see imperialism as a world system that extends over centuries, sometimes dating back to Christopher Columbus or even the Crusades. The term is now understood through multiple perspectives—moral, economic, systemic, cultural, and temporal—reflecting changes in sensibility and growing discomfort with Western power.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:**  \nWhat are the five axes along which the meaning of \"imperialism\" has shifted?\n\n**Answer:**  \nAccording to the passage, the meaning of \"imperialism\" has shifted along five axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:**  \nWhat does the shift in the application and meaning of \"imperialism\" reflect about Western society?\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe shift in the meaning and application of \"imperialism\" reflects a growing unease or squeamishness with the reality of power, particularly the power held by Western societies."

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a question-answer format.\n\nPassage:\nImperialism\nIn anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.\n\nQuestion 1: "

The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\").

Several theories exist about its derivation. One suggests the nickname combines a reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues and the Dutch word \"Huisgenoten\" (meaning \"housemates\"), linking to the German word \"Eidgenosse,\" which means \"confederate.\" Besançon Hugues was a Catholic leader of Geneva's \"Confederate Party,\" which supported independence from the Duke of Savoy via connections to the Swiss Confederation. Geneva was also the center of the Calvinist movement under John Calvin. The term \"Huguenot\" was first used in France in 1560 to describe aristocratic members of the Reformed Church involved in the failed Amboise plot to challenge the House of Guise. The nickname thus associated Protestants with Swiss politics, which were unpopular in France at the time.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like more questions and answers or have specific aspects from the passage you want highlighted, please let me know!",

      "**Question 1:** Why does bounding computation time by a specific function often yield machine model-dependent complexity classes?\n\n**Answer 1:** Because the computation time needed to solve a problem can vary significantly between different machine models. For example, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be solved in linear time using a multi-tape Turing machine but requires quadratic time using a single-tape Turing machine. Therefore, the definition of complexity classes based on concrete time bounds depends on the specific computational model used.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** What does the Cobham-Edmonds thesis state regarding different models of computation?\n\n**Answer 2:** The Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related.\" This means that if a problem can be solved in polynomial time on one reasonable model, it can also be solved in polynomial time on any other reasonable model, possibly with a different polynomial degree.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** What is the complexity class P, and what does it represent?\n\n**Answer 3:** The complexity class P is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. In other words, these are problems for which there exists an algorithm that can decide the answer in time bounded by a polynomial function of the input size.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** What is the corresponding class to P for function problems?\n\n**Answer 4:** The corresponding class to P for function problems is called FP.

      "**Question 1:** Why does bounding computation time by a specific function \\( f(n) \\) sometimes create complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model?\n\n**Answer 1:** Because the time it takes to solve a problem can vary significantly depending on the machine model used.

Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.",

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a question-answer format.\n\nPassage:\nMartin Luther\nIn accordance with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty. Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.\n\nQuestion 1: "

The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes.

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a question-answer format.\n\nPassage:\nFresno, California\nHomes from the early 20th century line this boulevard in the heart of the historic Alta Vista Tract. The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.\n\nQuestion 1: "

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours. His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of \"trading-class stock and middling means\" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498.

      "**Question 1:** How is new legislation generally made in the European Union?\n\n**Answer 1:**  \nAccording to TFEU article 294, most new EU legislation is made using the \"ordinary legislative procedure.\" This involves three readings, starting with a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament must vote by a majority of all Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to block or suggest changes, while the Council must approve changes by a qualified majority, but needs unanimity to block Commission amendments. If no agreement is reached at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" with representatives from Parliament, the Council, and the Commission tries to negotiate a joint text, which is then sent back to Parliament and Council for approval. Legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in Council, or a majority in the Commission, making it easier to block changes than to pass new laws.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** What procedure is followed for the EU budget?\n\n**Answer 2:**  \nA different procedure is used for the EU budget (details of which are not specified in this passage).\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** What is \"enhanced cooperation,\" and how does it work?\n\n**Answer 3:**  \n\"Enhanced cooperation\" allows a subset of at least several member states to work together more closely in certain areas.

Some member state courts claim this right, some member state parliaments claim it, while the EU's Court of Justice asserts that it has the final say.",
      "**Question 1:** What is the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" in the European Union, and how does it work?\n\n**Answer 1:**  \nThe \"ordinary legislative procedure,\" defined in TFEU article 294, is the main process for creating new EU laws. It starts with a proposal from the European Commission. After that, the European Parliament can block or propose changes to the law by a majority of all MEPs, while the Council of the EU can approve changes by a qualified majority or block amendments from the Commission only by unanimity. If the Parliament and Council can't agree, a Conciliation Committee is formed with members from the Parliament, Council, and Commission to try to reach a compromise. If they do, the compromise text goes back to the Parliament and Council for approval. This system makes it easier to keep laws as they are, since a law can be blocked at several stages: by a majority in the Parliament, a minority in the Council, or a majority in the Commission.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** How is legislation for the EU budget created, and does it follow the same process as ordinary legislation?\n\n**Answer 2:**  \nNo, legislation regarding the EU budget follows a different procedure, separate from the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** What is \"enhanced cooperation\" and how is it authorized within the EU?\n\n**Answer 3:**  \n\"Enhanced cooperation\" allows a subset of at least a minimum number of member states to cooperate more closely in certain areas. It requires authorization from the Council of the European Union to proceed.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** What information must the Commission provide to member states before starting the legislative process?\n\n**Answer 4:**  \nBefore beginning the legislative process, the European Commission must inform member state governments of its proposals.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:** Are there limits to the EU’s authority, and who determines those limits?\n\n**Answer 5:**  \nYes, the EU can only act within the powers (competences) given to it by the Treaties. According to TEU articles 4 and 5, any powers not specifically given to the EU remain with the member states. However, there is debate over who has the final authority (\"Kompetenz-Kompetenz\") to define the EU’s powers: some member state courts and parliaments believe they do, while the Court of Justice of the European Union maintains that it has the final say.",

For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas.

    "context": "While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light.

This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.

This prepares them to receive Christ's fulfillment of the law, which is offered in the gospel. Luther emphasizes that anything—whether it is Christ’s life, His death for sin, or God’s goodness in creation—that leads a person to feel sorrow over sin can be called the law. He insists that simply stopping the preaching of the Ten Commandments or removing the word “law” from church practice does not remove the effect of the accusing law.

When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

    "context": "Newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.",

      "**Question 1:** Why are there four different timelines used to display the geologic time scale in the passage?\n\n**Answer 1:**  \nThere are four different timelines because the entire geologic time scale covers an extremely long period, from the formation of the Earth to the present. The first timeline shows the whole scale, but in doing so, it compresses the most recent eon so much that its details aren't clear. Therefore, the second timeline expands the most recent eon. Similarly, the third timeline expands the most recent era from the second timeline, and the fourth timeline further expands the very short Quaternary period, which has very short epochs. Each timeline after the first is a subsection of the previous one in order to show more detail.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** What is the purpose of expanding the fourth time scale, according to the passage?\n\n**Answer 2:**  \nThe fourth time scale is expanded because the Quaternary period is very short and has short epochs, making it difficult to show details, such as the Holocene epoch, in the previous timelines. By expanding this period on the fourth scale, the Holocene epoch and the short epochs of the Quaternary can be shown more clearly.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** What do the abbreviations \"P\" and \"Q\" stand for on the timeline?\n\n**Answer 3:**  \nIn the passage, \"P\" stands for the Pleistocene epoch and \"Q\" stands for the Quaternary period.",
      "**Question 1:** Why are there four different timelines shown in the geologic time scale?\n\n**Answer:**  \nThere are four different timelines because each subsequent scale expands upon the most recent period compressed in the previous one. The first timeline covers the entire history of the Earth, but it compresses recent times. The second timeline expands the most recent eon, but compresses the most recent era. The third timeline expands the most recent era, and the fourth timeline further expands the very short and recent Quaternary period. This allows important, recent events to be shown in greater detail.  \n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** How are the second, third, and fourth timelines related to their preceding timelines?\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe second, third, and fourth timelines are each subsections of their preceding timeline, as indicated by asterisks.

Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana. The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.\n\nQuestion 1: "

      "**Question 1:** What unusual distinction does the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network have in some markets?\n\n**Answer 1:**  \nThe ABC network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates that serve the same market in certain cities. Specifically, this situation occurs in Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV), and an analogous situation in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV).\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** Why is KQTV, which is licensed to St. Joseph, Missouri, considered a separate market from Kansas City, Missouri, even though the cities are close to each other?\n\n**Answer 2:**  \nKQTV is considered a separate market from Kansas City because St. Joseph is designated by Nielsen as its own market, even though it is located within 55 miles (89 km) of Kansas City.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** What reason is given for the existence of WWSB and WOTV as additional affiliates in their markets?\n\n**Answer 3:**  \nWWSB and WOTV serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate. For example, in Tampa, WWSB was necessary to serve the southern part of the Tampa market, including Sarasota, because the primary affiliate's (WTSP's) transmitter was short-spaced to avoid interfering with a Miami affiliate's signal.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:** What technical reason caused WTSP’s transmitter in Tampa to be limited in its coverage, leading to the necessity for WWSB?\n\n**Answer 4:**  \nWTSP’s transmitter in Tampa was short-spaced to avoid interfering with the analog signal of Miami affiliate WPLG; both stations broadcast on VHF channel 10. This technical limitation restricted WTSP’s signal and made it necessary for WWSB to fill coverage gaps in the southern Tampa market.",
      "**Question 1:** What unusual distinction does the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) have regarding its affiliates?\n\n**Answer:**  \nABC uniquely has separately owned and operated affiliates serving the same market in certain areas, specifically Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV). A similar situation exists in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV).\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:** Why does Kansas City, Missouri, have two ABC affiliates, and how is KQTV’s license different?\n\n**Answer:**  \nIn Kansas City, there is an analogous situation because KQTV is licensed to St. Joseph, Missouri, which Nielsen designates as a separate market from Kansas City, even though the two cities are less than 55 miles (89 km) apart.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:** Why do WWSB and WOTV serve areas that their market's primary ABC affiliate does not cover adequately?\n\n**Answer:**  \nWWSB and WOTV serve regions that do not receive a sufficient signal from their market’s main ABC affiliate. For WWSB, this goes back to when WTSP was Tampa's primary ABC affiliate before 1994. WWSB was needed to serve the southern Tampa market, including Sarasota. This was because WTSP’s transmitter had to be short-spaced to avoid interfering with the analog signal of Miami's ABC affiliate, WPLG, since both broadcast on VHF channel 10.",
      "**Question 1:**  \nWhat unusual distinction does the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network have regarding its affiliates in certain markets?\n\n**Answer 1:**  \nABC has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates serving the same market in several locations, including Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV), and an analogous situation in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV).\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:**  \nWhy does KQTV, licensed to St. Joseph, Missouri, serve a similar market to Kansas City’s KMBC-TV, even though they are close together?\n\n**Answer 2:**  \nKQTV is licensed to St. Joseph, Missouri, which is considered by Nielsen to be a separate market from Kansas City, even though the two cities are within 55 miles (89 km) of each other.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:**  \nWhy do WWSB and WOTV serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate?\n\n**Answer 3:**  \nWWSB and WOTV serve these areas because the market’s primary ABC affiliate does not provide an adequate signal. For example, WWSB serves the southern part of the Tampa market, including Sarasota, due to historical issues with WTSP's transmitter positioning, which was short-spaced to avoid interfering with another ABC affiliate’s analog signal (WPLG in Miami).\n\n---\n\n**Question 4:**  \nWhat historical situation caused WWSB to be necessary for the southern part of the Tampa market?\n\n**Answer 4:**  \nWWSB became necessary for the southern part of the Tampa market (including Sarasota) because WTSP’s transmitter was short-spaced to prevent interference with the analog signal of WPLG in Miami—both were broadcast on VHF channel 10. This made WTSP’s signal inadequate for some areas, leading to the need for WWSB as an additional affiliate.",

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.

      "**Question 1:**  \nWhat are the two main classes of modern primality tests for general numbers, and how do they differ?\n\n**Answer 1:**  \nThe two main classes of modern primality tests for general numbers are probabilistic (or \"Monte Carlo\") algorithms and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms, such as trial division, always give a certain answer about whether a number is prime or composite if performed correctly. Probabilistic algorithms are typically faster but do not completely prove that a number is prime; instead, they use randomization and can only increase our confidence that a number is prime, though not with absolute certainty.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2:**  \nHow does a probabilistic primality test determine if a number is likely prime or composite?\n\n**Answer 2:**  \nA probabilistic primality test determines if a number is likely prime by running a sequence of tests that involve randomness. If the number passes every test, the chance that it is actually composite decreases exponentially with the number of successful tests. The probability that a composite number would pass all the tests is given by 1/(1-p)^n, where p is the probability of passing the test once for a composite number and n is the number of times the test is repeated. However, if the number fails any test, it is definitely composite.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3:**  \nWhat can be concluded if a number fails a probabilistic primality test even once?\n\n**Answer 3:**  \nIf a number fails a probabilistic primality test even once, it can be concluded with certainty that the number is composite.",

They might always correctly identify a prime number, but for composites, there is only a probability \\( p \\) that the test will (incorrectly) pass it as prime. Their key limitation is that they cannot give absolute certainty that a number is prime, only a high probability.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:**  \nHow can we reduce the chance of error in probabilistic primality testing?\n\n**Answer:**  \nBy repeating the test multiple times (\\( n \\) times), the chance that a composite number passes as prime becomes \\( 1/(1-p)^n \\), which decreases exponentially, making us increasingly confident (though never perfectly certain) that the number is prime.\n\n---\n\n**Question 6:**  \nWhat does it mean if a probabilistic primality test fails for a given number?\n\n**Answer:**  \nIf a probabilistic test ever fails for a number, it means the number is composite for sure.\n\n---",

Repeating the test multiple times reduces the chance of mistaking a composite number for a prime.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5:** What happens if a probabilistic primality test ever fails?\n\n**Answer:** If the probabilistic primality test fails even once, then we know for sure that the number is composite.\n\n---\n\n**Question 6:** If a number passes a probabilistic test n times, how certain can we be that it is actually prime?\n\n**Answer:** If a number passes the probabilistic test n times, the probability that it is actually composite drops exponentially; specifically, it is 1/(1-p)^n, where p is the probability the test would pass for a composite number.

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n\nQuestion 1: "

However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges, which shows there must be infinitely many primes.\n\n---\n\nQuestion 2: What conclusion about prime numbers can be drawn from the divergence of the harmonic series?\n\n**Answer 2:** Because the harmonic series diverges (it exceeds any given number), this indicates that there cannot be only finitely many primes, so there must be infinitely many prime numbers.\n\n---\n\nQuestion 3: What does Euler's identity related to the zeta function and the Basel problem demonstrate?\n\n**Answer 3:** Euler’s identity related to the zeta function and the Basel problem provides an example of the richness of the zeta function, and it offers a glimpse into modern algebraic number theory. The explicit identity itself is not shown in the passage, but it is mentioned as a noteworthy example.",
      "**Question 1:**  \nHow is the zeta function related to prime numbers, and how does it demonstrate that there are infinitely many primes?\n\n**Answer 1:**  \nThe zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. If there were only finitely many primes, the value of the zeta function at 1, written as ζ(1), would be finite. However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges, meaning it will exceed any given number and does not settle at a finite value. This divergence implies that there must be infinitely many primes. The connection between the zeta function and prime numbers also appears in results like the Basel problem, discovered by Euler, which highlights the depth and complexity of the zeta function in number theory.",

As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD.

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a question-answer format.\n\nPassage:\nRhine\nSince ~3000 yr BP (= years Before Present), human impact is seen in the delta. As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.\n\nQuestion 1: "
